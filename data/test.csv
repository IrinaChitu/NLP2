[Ed Sheeran:]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Beyonce:]
Well I found a man, stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
[Beyonce & Ed Sheeran:]
While listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
And he looks perfect
No I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

I won't, I won't
I won't, I won't
'Cause I came too far

Tryin' to know what's going on
Echoes on my celluar phone
I notice a couple items missin'
Could it be the feds still listenin'

See, I don't beat those cases
Did time for the miscellanous
And they proceed to keep on watchin'
'Cause I don't seen them lately

Interrogated my mom
Locked up half of my crew
But I can guarantee one thing
That I won't let you

I won't, let you lock me down
I won't, let you push me 'round
I won't, let you stop me now
I won't, 'cause I came too far

I won't, let you ruin my day
I won't, let you stop my pay
I won't, no, not today
I won't 'cause I came too far

Devil's always watchin' me
Evils always stalkin' me
God has been protectin' me
And that's how I got this far

'Cause when you look at me
You see an angel
Can't believe I been through half the things
That I went through

'Cause everyday I see a face
Misconstrued by the human race
So please don't judge me unless you know me
'Cause I won't let you

I won't, let you lock me down
I won't, let you push me 'round
I won't, let you stop me now
I won't, 'cause I came too far

I won't, let you ruin my day
I won't, let you stop my pay
I won't, no, not today
I won't 'cause I came too far

Came too far to turn back now
Came too far to turn back now
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Ain't nobody gonna stop me

Came too far to turn back now
Came too far to turn back now
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Ain't nobody gonna stop me

I won't, let you lock me down
I won't, let you push me 'round

There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see
Why did you have to leave me
Why did you deceive me
You send me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Nevermore
Nevermore

5216,Madonna,1996.0,Oh What A Circus,"soundtrack: ""Evita""","

[Che:]
Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

[Crowd:]
Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy 
Our life, sweetness, and hope 
Hail, hail, oh queen 
To you we cry, exiled sons of Eve 
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping 
Oh clement, oh loving one 

[Che:]
You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

[Crowd:]
Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina Peron
Ad te clamamus exules filii Eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia

[Eva:]
Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention
Unless we all are, I think we all are
So share my glory, so share my coffin
So share my glory, so share my coffin

[Che:]
It's our funeral too

My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose

Every time you go away
It actually kinda makes my day
Every time you leave you slam the door

You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think you're hurting me
You leave me laughing on the floor

'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that

You know I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I thought we were just hanging out
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth
You thought the way you taste would get me high

You went to all your friends to brag
Guys are always such a drag
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you was to say goodbye

'Cause I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that

You know I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

Hanging, hanging out
I am simply hanging, hanging out
I am simply hanging
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth?

Why'd you kiss me?

Don't you know that I

I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a shit about you
I don't give a damn about you
I don't give a shit about you

I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit

Time to sweep the fallen leaves away

We can chase the dark clouds from the sky

I gave my promise to you girl

We know how to change the world
That is why I gave my promise to you girl

Hey why wait another day

All the time that it takes
To repair this brave old world will be ours

No more howling at the moon

There is darkness and death in your eyes
What have you got buried inside
The shallow grave in your soul
The ghosts there have taken control
You really should have dug a little deeper there
Body parts are starting to appear and scare
The child inside away

Each tear that flows down your face
Trickles then picks up the pace
And turns to a river inside
A river that will not subside
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned
The child inside your heart

I can see you drifting away
Heading for the light
I can see you drifting away
Every night

Why were you always inside
On days when the weather was fine
And while we were running around
You were nowhere to be found
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
But you were made to play games with your soul instead
The child inside you died

If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody

So I sat in the attic, a piano up my nose
And the wind played a dreadful cantata
Sore was I from a crack of an enemy's hose
And the horrible sound of tomato

Ketchup
Soup and puree
Don't get left behind
Ketchup
Soup and puree
Don't get left behind

When a rattle of rats had awoken
The sinews, the nerves and the veins

In attempts to repeat this refrain

And my hair is a tangled beretta (beretta, beretta)

When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to-
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me

Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms

Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you

What's it all about
Alfie
Is it just for the moment we live
What's it all about
When you sort it out
Alfie
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind
And if only fools are kind
Alfie
Then I guess
It is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs
Only to the strong
Alfie
What will  you lend on
An old golden rule
As sure as I believe
There's a heaven above
Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers
Can believe in
I believe in love

Without true love you just exist

Until you find the love you've missed
You're nothing

When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day

In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyze my fears
Analyze my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams

Things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always watch me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all

Still things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I'm a numb

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul

I feel the world closing in on me
Here comes the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

What now my love

No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live or die

Don't rush, take time, take some

Now I gotta erase some with you

Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

Plus I got that ass like Selena
And you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch

Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this

Yeah, and they say big girls don't cry
Baby, I cried
The real ones don't lie

You don't even know what you just had

Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white

Some of you all never been down South too much...
I' gonna tell you a little story, so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields,
and it looks something like a turnip green.
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad.
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
she'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it...
Carry it home and cook it for supper, 'cause that's about all they had to eat,
But they did all right.

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman

Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack

Polk salad Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, dispiteful, straight-razor totin' woman,
Lord have mercy.

Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah

But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck

For once Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang

Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention

When did your name change from a word to a charm?
No other sound makes the hair stand up on the back of my arm
All of the letters pushed to the front of my mouth
And saying your name is somewhere between a prayer and a shout
And I can't get it out

When did your name change from language to magic?
I'd write it again on the back of my hand
And I know it sounds tragic

Your name's like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted to your love
I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

Now that your name
Pumps like the blood in my veins
Pulse through my body, igniting my mind
It's like MDMA and that's OK

Your name's like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

I need this exchange
I don't care if you think that I'm strange
Something happens to me when I hear your voice
Something happens to me and I have no choice

I need to hear your name
Everything feels so strange
I'm ready to take this chance
I need to dance

Feels like a drug
And I can't get enough
And it fits like a glove
I'm addicted to your love

I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your
I'm addicted, I'm addicted, I'm addicted to your love

Time has a way of changing everything
That goes for almost anything but us
Always have and I always will remain
Words from a heart that you can trust

While others come and go
You can always know
I'm here for you
Whenever you might need me

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

You're still sweet as a honeybee, after all these years
And you'll always be that funny girl to me
Season to season we'll always have a reason
You mean, to be the best of friends that we can be

Someone you can turn to (I turn to you)
Every minute of the day
Warm memories to hold on to
That will never fade away

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

You're like a sweet familiar song
A good book when I'm alone
A cup of coffee when I'm cold
A country road that leads me home

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

Until I make it home again
I thank God he gave me you
We'll stay the way we were forever true
There's no one in this world that's been
A better friend to me than you

I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land

I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline.""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they're far away at sea

""I think I'll call it America,""
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buying a place with beads.""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail
For carryin' harpoons

Ah, me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Saying, ""Ban the bums.""
I jumped right into line
Saying, ""I hope that I'm not late.""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight

I went into a restaurant
Lookin' for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some Suzette, I said,
""Could you please make that Crepe?""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flying everywhere
I left without my hat

Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again

Well, I rapped upon a house
With the US flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way.""
The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb.""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too.""
He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop.""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went looking for a cop

I ran right outside
I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab.""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And a man asked me who I was

I repeated that my friends
Were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die.""
I shook his hand and said ""Goodbye""
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
And it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said ""Hello""
This foot came through the line

Well, by this time I's fed up
At trying to make a stab
At bringin' back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor's suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship

Well, I got back and took
The parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd.""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid

Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailin'
They were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, ""Good luck.""

Just listen to that, the voice of Argentina
We are adored, we are loved

Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants

[Eva's sister:]
We shall see little man

[Eva:]
I am only a simple woman
Who lives to serve Peron in his noble crusade 
To rescue his people
I was once as you are now, and I promise you this
We will take the riches from the oligarchs
Only for you, for all of you
And one day, you too will inherit these treasures
Descamisados, mis companeros
When they fire those cannons, when the crowds sing of glory
It is not just for Peron, but for all of us, for all of us

Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower-class
Can be respected and admired

I'm a-walkin' through the summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was goin' too fast
Today it's moving too slow.

I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you
If I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
I got nothing to go back to now.

The light in this place is so bad
Makin' me sick in the head
All the laughter is just makin' me sad
The stars have turned cherry red.

I'm strummin' on my gay guitar
Smokin' a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will any time soon
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Under the midnight moon.

Maybe they'll get me, and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near.

I've been ridin' the midnight train
Got ice water in my vein.

I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Sufferin' like a fool.

When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy you're older or more
I can hear the church bells ringin' in the yard
I wonder who they're ringin' for?

I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in.

Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one.

You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
In the dark land of the sun.

I'll eat when I'm hungry
Drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care.

It always meaned so much, even the softest touch.

I see nothin' to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said
You left me standin' in the doorway cryin'
Blues wrapped around my head.

Do you know them or will there be a fight ?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right ?

Do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind ?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line.

Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charm
No more affection that's misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms

He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn't dance.

There is nowhere else I can run to 
She is wretched but she comforts me
After everyone goes home
She's always there for me
And when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out the light

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight down

A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within

I become two
We become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone
The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of Hell
The warmth of Hell

And build a new reality
Draw another picture
Of the life you could've had
Follow your instincts
And choose the other path

You should never be afraid
You're protected from trouble and pain
Why, why is this a crisis in your eyes again

Come to be
How did it come to be
Tied to a railroad
No love to set us free
Watch our souls fade away
And our bodies crumble away
Don't be afraid

I will take the blow for you

I have had recurring nightmares
That I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity
To be a better man

Twenty two grand kids now growing old

On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, ""No

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

Is it a sin
To be flexible

Open the window and out go ideals

Drink

We all know boats don't last
We all know cars are fast

I will always love you no matter what
No matter where you go or what you do
And knowing you
You're gonna have to do things you're own way
And that's okay
So be free, spread your wings
And promise me just one thing...

If you ever need a place to cry
Baby, come to me
Come to me
I've always known that you were born to fly
But you can come to me
If the world breaks your heart
No matter where on Earth you are
You can come to me

Don't walk around with the world on you're shoulders
And you're highest hopes laying on the ground
I know you think you've gotta try to be my hero
But dont you know the stars you wish upon they fall its true
But I still belive in you

If you ever need a place to cry
Baby, come to me
Come to me
I've always known that you were born to fly
But you can come to me
If the world breaks your heart
No matter where on Earth you are
You can come to me

And the seven sea's you sail
All the winding road you're on
Leave you lost and feeling all alone
Let my heart be your beacon home

If you ever need a place to cry
Baby, come to me
Come to me
I've always known that you were born to fly
But you can come to me
When the world breaks your heart
No matter where on Earth you are
You can come to me

Relax, here we are alone
Relax, if the phone rings, let it
Just forget it, we're not at home

Cut loose, let your hair down honey
Unwind, turn the lights down low
Relax, let's uncork the stopper
Come to papa, come on let's go

Defrost, your charms
There's only the two of us here
Come in my arms
And make yourself comfortable dear

Relax, let's get cozy baby
Come on, let your concrete crack
Cut loose, when the knock's invited
Don't you fight it, come on relax

The chimes of time ring out the news,
Another day is through.
Someone slipped and fell.
Was that someone you?

You may have longed for added strength,
Your courage to renew.
Do not be disheartened,
For I have news for you.

It is no secret what God can do.
What He's done for others, He'll do for you.
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you.
It is no secret what God can do.

There is no night for in His light
You never walk alone.
Always feel at home,
Wherever you may go.

There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side.
Take Him at His promise,
Don't run away and hide.

It is no secret what God can do.
What He's done for others, He'll do for you.
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you.
It is no secret what God can do.

Been checking all the places
Where we used to go (used to go)
Been looking for your face inside the crowd
I've been talking to the people that we used to know
But nobody wants to say, where you hang out
And when I call your phone
Seems like your never, ever home
And you don't return my calls (return my calls)
It tears me apart (it tears me apart)
It's breaking up my heart (it's breaking up my heart)

Hung around my room (around my room)
They're the only thing that's left of you and me
Girl, what can I do to make you come back soon
And make it just the way it used to be?
Oh, is there someone new?
Could never go on without you
Girl I don't wanna think about it (think about it)
I can't sleep at night (can't sleep at night)
No, this can't be right (this can't be right)

We used to love so strong
Tell me where did we go wrong
Oh baby, I'm missing you

But it sure ain't happened yet

I know there's a chance for you and I
And I believe there's no way our love could die
So no matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you
And whatever it takes I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there

Alone and far from home, I'll find you

Dead, like a candle you burned out
Spill the wax over the spaces
Left in place of angry words
Scream to be heard
Like you needed any more attention
Throw the bottle, break the door, and disappear

Sing me to sleep
I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say
""I miss you. I'm so sorry.""

Forevers never seemed so long
As when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing
I could have learned so much from you
But what's left now?

Don't you realize you showed this family a world of pain?
Can't you see this could have been
The happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
Ah-ah

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach

So bold and fine
I’ve known you for some time.
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine

Go dance in the woods
And down we go, down, down
Oh, boy, you’re mine
Do you remember old times?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

Sweet love of mine
Destruction ain't a crime
For those who find
Love is a game like you and I

Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried
Oh, boy, we're fine
Do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too

Tell me a piece of your history
that you're proud to call your own
Speak in words you picked up
 as you walked through life alone
We used to swim in your stories
 and be pulled down by their tide
Choking on the water, drowning, with no air in sight

Now you've hit a wall and it's not your fault
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard,
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words in that head of yours
And oh, oh can you feel the silence?
I can't take it anymore
Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill the silence?

Tell me a piece of your history 
that you've never said out loud
Pull the rug beneath my feet 
and shake me to the ground
Wrap me around your fingers,
break the silence open wide
Before it seeps into my ears
and fills me up from the inside

Now you've hit a wall and you're lost for words
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard

The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesn't matter

We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears

And you're out to save the world

Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I've ever seen
Hey sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' Are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

They took me to a room without a table
They said ""blow your trumpet into here""
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was
Sleepin' like a princess
Never touched the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(have to have some fun. . .)

Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
And that I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here

I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

Rollin' down the road

Sure do wanna go home

Waiting for life to go by.

You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though
They were my own dreams and they're only in my head

I said, ""Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain""
He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane""
He grabbed my arm, I said, ""Ouch!""
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, ""Tell me about it""

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on

Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road
It was a normal day

Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
""Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man""
A shotgun fired and away I ran
I don't blame them too much though
They didn't know me

Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said, ""Howdy friend, I guess there's just us two""
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
""Let's go and play Adam and Eve""
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, ""Hey man, you crazy or sumpin'
You see what happened last time they started""

Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun'
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down to 42nd Street
In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war

Well, I remember seein' some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn't work so well
Turned on my record player—
It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin', ""Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love's A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah""

I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
""When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock""
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Sayin', ""Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me
I didn't see you around""

Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody's having them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walkin' around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can't be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
""I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours""
I said that

When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

Judas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Follow you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of evil man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
Strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

After school walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass

And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun.""

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun.""

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me

Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles—.""

Feeling love...that's all,
That's enough for me, Yet I see...I see...
Faces...covered-up and empty-eyed,
Empy spaces...where there used to be o soul inside.
Norhing and no one ever gets to you,
Seems the wind could blow right through you,
Believing in Gods that never knew you.
I believe in love, I believe in love, I believe in feeling good
And that's feeling love
Now, worry...climbing up your money tree,
You got to hurry...monkey do what monkey see.
You're on o one-way street and you're speeding,
Missing the signs you ought be reading,
Passing things you'll later be needing
I believe in love...
I believe it-nobody sold me
Always knew it-nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me
I believe in love, I believe in love. I do
I believe in feeling good and that's feeling love
(Feeling love is feeling good etc...)
Feeling love...That 's all, that's enough for me, I won't be....
Don't want to be lonely...sleeping in on empty bed,
Shouldn't be only a place to rest my head
I don't want to find myself one day
Waking up and looking at Monday
Wirh some ""What's-His Nome"" left from Sunday,
I believe in love, I believe it--nobody sold me
Always knew it-nobody told me
I believe in someone to hold me, I believe in love
I believe in love, I believe in feeling good
Ev'rybody should, believe in feeling good
Believin'...Believin' love!

In the sad seclusion of her nursery
Go outside, Martina! Go outside and play
Never speak, Martina, put your toys away
So her days were loveless
And her nights the same

No one ever came...

That she loved nobody and her young heart grew old
All the children crying from the age of three
Grow to be Martina's and me...

Baby, I don't want to spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn't pass right by you

Maybe it's because you are so insecure
And maybe you plain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
It falls away and it's just not there

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation

(I want it.)

Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be

Now I'm facing something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?

I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot I forget to breathe, yeah

Missy and Madonna boy, ain't nothin' better
Hotter than fat bitches dancin' in a sweater
Madonna am I okay skinny or fatter
When I rap on this track *sniff* all I smell is cheddar
You and I together, yo' we're tougher than leather
Make pop artists scatter when we talk chit-chatter
It really don't matter what time of day or weather
Or who's ass really fatter, my kadunk-kadunk badder
A rap so sick, won't stop, won't quit
All on my dick, like my name was 50 Cent, G-Unit!
I come with the heat, see my hits
Sound so sweet, Missy ain't pissy
Is you dizzy, is you with me
Tip me when you see me, 'cause you tryna get with me
Madonna bring the drama, oh mama that's trauma
Tougher than armor for your papa and your mama

I'd like to express my extreme point of view

So I went into a bar, looking for sympathy
A little company, I tried to find a friend

This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free
Do I have to change my name? (C'mon)

American life (American life)
I live the American dream (American dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream

[Verse 3: Madonna]
I tried to stay ahead, I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part, but some how I forgot
Just what I did it for, and why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
Fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it, uh-huh

This is, the American life, fuck it

It goes right through my body
And you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper
And I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo they tell I'm a trooper
And you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and palates
And the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies
And you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysic's shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager
An agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant
And a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler
And a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realised that nothing
Is what it seems

Break me in
Teach us to cheat
And to lie, cover up
What shouldn't be shared?
And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away
At my mind
Please stop asking me to describe

For one moment
I wish you'd hold your stage
With no feelings at all
Open-minded
I'm sure I used to be so free

Self-expressed, exhausting for all
To see and to be
What you want and what you need
And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away
At my mind
Please stop asking me to describe

For one moment

Clean your body of me
Erase all the memories
They only bring us pain
And I've seen all I'll ever need

Sleeping very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round
Gotta clear outta town
I'm smelling like a dry-fish bone

Here come the Law,
Gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never,
I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Stone-cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon
I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore,
Cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Stone-cold crazy, you know

Hit 'em up

Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet
With my rubber Tommy water gun
Here come the deputy
He's gonna come and get a me
I gotta get me get up and run

They got the sirens loose
I ran right out of juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

Father has a business strictly second hand
Everything from toothpicks to a baby-grand
Stuff in our apartment came from father's store
Even things I'm wearing someone wore before
It's no wonder that I feel abused
I never get a thing that ain't been used
I'm wearing second hand hats
Second hand clothes
That's why they call me
Second hand Rose

Even our piano in the parlor
Father bought for ten cents on the dollar
Second hand pearls
I'm sick of second hand curls
I never get a single think that's new
Even Jake, the plumber, he's a man I adore
Had the nerve to tell me he's been married before!

Everyone knows that I'm just
Second hand Rose
From second Avenue!
From Second Avenue! Nu!

One more time!
Everyone knows that I'm just
Second hand Rose

From what?
Let's see if you know the fills!
Once while strooling
Through the Ritz a girl got my goat...

And said oh look there goes
My old fur coat)
You don't need me!

Everyone knows that I'm just

Seven lonely days
And a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night
And you were gone
Don't know why you'd run,
What you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home

So I'm walking in the rain,
Thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long
And my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing
What went wrong

Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town
That I'll go walking thru
With the rain in my shoes,
Searchin for you
In the cold Kentucky rain,
In the cold Kentucky rain

Showed your photograph
To some old gray bearded man
Sitting on a bench
Outside a gen'ral store
They said ""Yes, she's been here""
But their memory wasn't clear
Was it yesterday,
No, wait the day before

So I fin'ly got a ride
With a preacher man who asked
""Where you bound on such a cold dark afternoon?""
As we drove on thru the rain
As he listened I explained
And he left me with a prayer
That I'd find you
"
2574,Bob Dylan,1965.0,"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)","""Bringing It All Back Home""","

Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying.

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel the moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred.

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred.

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
And goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked.

And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you.

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you.

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to.

But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destiny
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in.

While some on principles baptize
To strict party platforms ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say ""God Bless him"".

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in.

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.

Old lady judges, watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony.

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely.

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scoff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.

I was searching 
You were on a mission 
Then our hearts combined like 
A neutron star collision 

I have nothing left to lose 
You took your time to choose 
Then we told each other 
With no trace of fear that... 

Our love would be forever 
And if we die 
We die together 
And lie, I said never 
'Cause our love would be forever 

The world is broken 
Halos fail to glisten 
You try to make a difference 
But no one wants to listen 

Hail, The preachers, fake and proud 
Their doctrines will be cloud 
Then they'll dissipate 
Like snowflakes in an ocean 

Love is forever 
And we'll die, we'll die together 
And lie, I say never 
'Cause our love could be forever 

Now I've got nothing left to lose 
You take your time to choose 
I can tell you now without a trace of fear 

That my love will be forever 
And we'll die we'll die together 
Lie, I will never 
'Cause our love will be forever

5952,Michael Jackson,,On The Line,,"

No sense pretending it's over
Hard times just don't go away
You gotta take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up, have some faith

Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time (yes it does)
You gotta have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open your mind, hee

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

You see yourself in the mirror
And you don't like what you see
And things aren't getting much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change, oh

Don't waste your time on the past, no no
It's time you look to the future, oh
It's all right there if you ask
This time if you try much harder
You'll be the best that you can be, oh

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

If you wanna make it right
And you wanna do it now
Then you gotta learn to try
And you'll make it work somehow
No, nothing in life comes free
And that's just the way it is now
You gotta go for what you want
You gotta know what you got to stand for

Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting
The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
I wouldn't change a thing that happened
On my way to you...

It's the first time I ever felt this lonely
Wish someone would cure this pain
It's funny when you think it's gonna work out
'Til you chose weed over me, you're so lame

I thought you were cool until the point
Up until the point you didn't call me
When you said you would
Finally figured out you're all the same
Always coming up with some kind of story

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You can't
You're too tough
You think you're loveless
Is that too much that I'm asking for?

Thought you'd come around when I ignored you
Sort of thought you'd have the decency to change
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning
'Cause I'm not about to look at your face again

Can't you see that you lie to yourself
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

But every time I try to make you smile
You'd always go off feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh
You'd stand like a stone
Alone in your zone
Is that too much that I'm asking for?

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can't find where I am
Lying here
Alone in fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim
Alone again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't you see that you lie to yourself
You can't see the world through a mirror
It won't be too late when the smoke clears
'Cause I, I am still here

Every time I try to make you smile
You're always feeling sorry for yourself
Every time I try to make you laugh

You're asleep on the couch with Tammy
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried

You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shaking
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it
And you say, ""Screw you!""
I say, ""I love you!""
And I know it's true

You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it
But you're close to tears
Oh God! I'm sorry for the wasted years

(Not the one I could have been)
You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like I'm wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most' cause you are mine

How you listen to a girl that still wanna man
Tell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Mann
I'm wonderin' why she ""ret to go"" like Wanda then
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I'll trade in my cab
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I call you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around and giggle said, ""You so nuts!""
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get the new numba
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together

So young, so full of life and vibrant
Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went
So close almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why
Is it that you surcame to yours
And mine I survived it
You ran the streets I nine to fived it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises
Now I feel the vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold your touch, it's like ice
And your eyes is the look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together

Uh, stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast, don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas, it's never a need for brakes
Smoke ez-riders with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars, a waiter to bring my plate
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads my niggas who got love for me
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, I'm a stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoking degraded
Speculating me landing must of got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the planes
You's a runner on the jet way

A drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together

In the beginning
Back in nineteen-fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
An' all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news

He said, ""Let there be sound""
There was sound
""Let there be light""
There was light
""Let there be drums""
There was drums
""Let there be guitar""
There was guitar

Oh, let there be rock

And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
And all across the land, every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The businessmen got rich
And in every bar, there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen-million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say:

""Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar""

Oh, let there be rock

One night, in the club called ""The Shaking Hand""
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good, and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

""Let there be rock""

3404,Depeche Mode,,A Song For Europe,,"

Here
As I sit
At this empty cafe
Thinking of you

I remember
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again

Though the world
Is my oyster
It's only a shell
Full of memories

Here by the Seine
Notre-Dame casts
A long lonely shadow

Now only sorrow
No tomorrow
There's no today for us

Nothing is there
For us to share
But yesterday

This is my song
This is my song
This is my song

These cities may change
But there always remains
My obsession

Through silken waters
My gondola glides
And the bridge
it sighs

I remember
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again

There's no more time for us
Nothing is there
For us to share
But yesterdays

All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again

All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again

All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again

Well I'm lookin the world over
Looking far off into the east
And i see my baby comin'
She's walking with the village beast
I feel a change comin' on
And the last part of the day's already gone

We got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends
I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already gone

Well life is for love
And they say that love is blind
If you wanna live easy
Baby, pack your clothes with mine
I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already gone

Well now what's the use in dreaming
You got better things to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

You are as porous as ever
Baby you can start a fire
I must be losing my mind
You're the object of my desire
I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already gone

I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And i'm reading James Joyce
Some people they tell me
I got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose
I feel a change comin' on
And the fourth part of the day's already gone

No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past

Like stars, we crash and burn
Only to return
Life goes by so fast

So who is left to blame
Nothing's quite the same
We can't live in the past

I'm burning as hot as the sun
And I've only just begun
Love, it fades so fast

Sometimes I forget
All I will regret
When I leave this world behind

Sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time

I know I've had enough
Maybe far too much
It's easy to be kind

When it's just me and you
I know what I have to do
I can leave this world behind

No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past

Like stars, we crash and burn
Only to return
Times they change so fast

Sometimes I forget
All I will regret
When I leave this world behind

Sometimes I'm not sure

Oh,
I am so nervous
I got a blind date waiting to call on me (any minute now)
I got a blind date what am I gonna see (any minute now)
Right over there's the doorway, he will be walking through

what an idiot)
One thing I know is Shirley ain't sitting on no shelf
If he was such a vow she'd keep him for herself (it's only natural)
She says she is he's nice and he deals in stocks (sounds good, but she's an

Wait wait, what am I praying he stands me up, I'll stand him up. I smell a rat
anyway. Umm. I'm gonna hide under the bed, he'll never see me, he'll walk in and look
around, I wouldn't be there, he'll go away and that's the end of that.

There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

Friends should sleep in other beds.
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do.
And I know that there's a limit to everything.
But my friends won't love me like you.
No, my friends won't love me like you do.
Oh, my friends will never love me like you.

642,Alec Benjamin,,Now She's Getting Married,,"

She was soft, she was kind
She was warm and she was mine
And now she's getting married, now she's getting married
And I'm not the one she'll kiss goodnight

We were young, I'll admit, but I thought that this was it
And now she's getting married, all my hope is buried
And I wonder if she ever thinks of

Ice cream in the park, dancing in the dark
And holding like she'd never let me go

She'll dress up, wearing white, while I wait for a wife
And now she's getting carried from the sanctuary
And they're driving down the streets where we once

Held each others hands, talked about our plans
And dreamed about the places we would go

Do you ever think, do you ever think, do you ever think of me?
Do you ever dream, do you ever dream, that we were meant to be?
Do you ever think, do you ever think, do you ever think of me?
Do you ever dream, do you ever dream that we were meant to be?

So if I, had the chance, I would ask for one last dance
I know we're not together, I'll love her forever
Even when I'm buried, now she's getting married

It's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here, baby

When you let me have my way
I was thinking I could get it again
Baby, we could be friends if you're lonely
And then you showed me just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind, tell me, where did you go?

When you left, I'm thinking, ""Which way did she go?""
I should have known that you led me on, girl
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreaming 'cause I never felt like this before

It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

Now it's raining and I'm looking over at the passenger side
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off
She was stopping and dropping me, switching from fast to slow
But that had nothing on how you got when I got you home

When you left, I'm thinking, ""Which way did she go?""
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I'm searching for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go

It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

You know
I really only thought
That this would be a one night stand
What you doing to me?
Come on
What you doing to me?

Maybe she's running home to someone else
Or maybe she lost my number in her cell
Or maybe she's run it down like this before
'Cause I can't see her not coming back for more, more

It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light

They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say ""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

The tributary of my heart

As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin

Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle

If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me

And my coagulating heart

Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, ""mercy""
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me

Use a knife on me

Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Supreme violation
Supreme violation

""Oh Jack I beseech you""

Blood in the foyer

The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed

I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick

Blood spurting from me
""Oh Jack, Jack I beseech...""
""Jack, I beseech you, I beseech...""
In the end it was an ordinary heart

""Oh Jack I beseech you""
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end, in the end, in the end

And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights

Sitting here alone and staring at the wall

Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights

Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know I've never lied to you

Mmm yeah, yeah

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

It's a tug of war
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outdo each other
In a tug of war

In another world
In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum

It's a tug of war
Though I know I mustn't grumble
It's a tug of war
But I can't let go
If I do you'll take a tumble
And the whole thing is going to crumble
It's a tug of war
(Pushing and pushing, pulling and pulling
Pushing and pulling)

In years to come they may discover
What the air we breathe and the life we lead
Are all about
But it won't be soon enough
Soon enough for me
No it won't be soon enough
Soon enough for me

In another world we could
Stand on top of the mountain
With our flag unfurled
In a time to come we will be
Dancing to the beat played
On a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum
We will be dancing to the beat
Played on a different drum

It's a tug of war
(A tug of war, a tug of war)
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
We expected more
But with one thing and another
We were trying to outscore each other
In a tug of war

Pulling and pulling

Here comes another dawn
For every child to see
This time the morning sun
Is burning just for me
I've got the skyward eyes
Like I've never had before
Just smile and  say  goodbye
Show me to the door
For every one there comes a precious time
To break away
I  mean  to  shine
Oh,  I  mean  to  shine
As I look  at all the morning  sun
I know I mean to shine
This day  I  realized
The  world  I  knew  is  gone
New seasons  come  and  change
The crown that stood upon
I've  been  afraid to feel
And scared of falling free
You  said  so I'm  real
It seemed  so clear to me
For everyone who breathes
There comes a time to fly  away
I  mean  to  shine
0h, I  mean  to shine
As  I  look at all the morning  sun
I know I mean to shine
For everyone who breathes
There comes a time
To break away
I mean to shine
Oh, I mean to shine
As I look at all morning sun
I know I  mean to shine.

So many 25ths of December
Just as many 4th of Julys
And we're still holding it together
It only comes down to you and I

I know that you can still remember
Things we said right from the start
When we said that this could be special
I'm keeping those words deep down in my heart

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

I never been much for occasions
But you never let a birthday go by
Mmmm without announcing how much you love me
But the truth was always there
Right there in your eyes

And we're still holding hands when we're walking
Acting like we've only just met
But how could that be - when there's so much history
I guess that's how true lovers can get

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye
Though another year has gone by

Another year has gone by
And I'm still the one by your side
After everything that's gone by
There's still no one saying goodbye

Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory
Or just another song, that's in my heart to linger on ?

And you willingly surrender to me, my darling will it last ?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright ?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight ?

You are the one girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

Rush of the past
I quietly crash and the tables turn
You're beautiful strange, defiantly brash
Be careful now

Kid you're a cut above
Always just a cut above the rest

If there's something left to be learned
Then my time is running
Why should I waste it all wasted on you?
I shouldn't be trusted to live and let go
When the last of my cities have burned
Then what's left in nothing
Why did I waste it all wasted on you?
I couldn't be trusted to live and let go

Fill in the blanks, pencil on paper
Disposable
Throw away lines
Intentional but unbelievable

Shaken and tried
Fade and resign as the tables turn
Let's slip away the renegade life you've been dreaming of

In the early morning glow

Have ya read the paper?
Ok, people talkin'
About which side they're takin'
And if you know then baby what's your take on it?
Does it make you want to leave?
'Cause I could look the other way for you

In the early morning glow

Reflected mountains in a lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Will something have to break?
Or would we stay awake?

Have ya read the paper?
People talkin'
Without no education
Go to college
Go find your major
Realize you're minor in the scheme of everything

Has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye

But the black guy doesn't die in this movie!
Fuckin' with Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kidding!
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in living!
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joining the KKK.
Or some real shit, though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck 'Lotto,' call me your leader
I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from ""Leave It To Beaver""
I used to like that show, now you got me to ""fight back"" mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go!
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends OK.
So I'll end this shit with a ""Fuck you, but have a nice day!""

Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid!
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
""Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity bloo blah!""
I ain't hear a word you said, ""hipidy hooblah!""
Is that a tank top, or a new bra?
Look, Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round, meat head?
Pay attention, you're sayin' the same shit that he said!
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful,
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it! You can take the mic home with you!
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you,
Tank top screamin', ""Lotto, I don't fit you!""
You see how far those white jokes get you
Boy's like ""How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?""

4716,Eminem,2020.0,Alfred's Theme,"""Music To Be Murdered By - Side B""","

Before I check the mic (Check, check, one, two)
I give it an extra swipe with a Lysol disinfectant wipe (Good evening)
Coronavirus in effect tonight
Antiseptics on deck, I got every type (Yeah)
I throw on my tux, then I (Yeah) give zero fucks, then I (Yeah)
Act like a jockstrap (Uh), cup my nuts, then I (Yeah)
Check my ball hair (What?), make sure it's all there (Yeah)
Then call the pallbearer (Yeah)
It's Music to Be Murdered By again, why stop?
Overkill like a pipe bomb in your pine box
You're all hitched to my cock (What?)
Went from punchin' a time clock to getting my shot
Then treated it like a cyclops
Like it's the only one I (Only one eye) got
And my thoughts are like nines cocked (Chk-chk)
Every line's obscene, pervertedest mind, got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
That's why there's parental advising (Visine) every time I drop (Eye drop)
So throw on the theme to Alfred, I'll channel him like the Panama Canal
But how could I get up in arms about you saying trash is all that I put out?
Bitch, I still get the bag when I'm putting garbage out
Plus, the potty mouth, I'm not about to wash it out
The filthiest, so all this talk about ""I'm washed up"", how preposterous
Because if cleanliness is next to godliness
It's obvious that it's impossible for me to be beside myself
And I'm 'bout that capital like a proper noun
Still on top the pile
Got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
Quick to call you out on your bullshit
Don't make me give that crock a dial
'Cause if I do it, see you later, alligator
Made it out the trailer, then I made a vow to cater to no one
So hate, I've gained about the same amount that's in my bank account
So here's some more shit for you to complain about, I say the
Bars that never slack (Yeah), but always get attacked (Yeah)
I think they're gunnin' for me, it's startin' to feel like that
Like I'm marked, 'cause when I rap, it's like fallin' on my back in a tar pit
'Cause I have this target on my back (Ew, yuck)
But if I ever double-crossed my fans and lost my Stans
I'd probably pop five Xans (Yeah)
Go in my garage, start my van
Inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust I can
And doze off like [*snores*]
But odds like that, with these thoughts I have's like a giant getting squashed by ants
If this is the test of time, I'd pass with flying colors
Like I just tossed my crayons (Tossed my crayons)
Small, medium, and large size cans
Sanitizers of all types, brands, cost nine bands
Which is a small price for Lysol wipes and
If my palms brush across my pants, I wash my hands

Shit, hold on, man
Motherfucker
Happy birthday to—
Fuck (Shh, quiet)

I sit in silence in candlelit environments
Sipping Wild Irish while getting violent
Homicidal visions when I'm spitting like this
But really I'm just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes
Which is really childish and silly, but I'm really like this
I'm giving nightmares to Billie Eilish, I'm Diddy's side bitch

What the fuck? Hold on, wait
""I'm Diddy's side bitch?""
Oh, I'm still east side, bitch

So 'til the E-N-D, since EPMD
Been givin' y'all the business (Yeah), D-R-E and me (Yup)
From the MMLP to (Huh?) MTBMB (Bitch)
Bitch, it's 2020, you still ain't seein' me (Haha)
So call me Santa Claus (Santa Claus)
'Cause at the present (Yeah), I out-rap 'em all (Wrap 'em all), I'm at the mall
Got your bitch in a bathroom stall, she could suck a basketball (Uh)
Through a plastic straw (Yeah) with a fractured jaw (Damn)
My dick is coat check (Ha), she wanna jack it off (Yeah)
I'm so far past the bar, I should practice law
Mentally, I'm fucked up generally (General Lee) (Duh)
Dukes of Hazzard car (Yeah), get the cadaver dogs
'Cause this is murder, murder and you'll get murked, murked
This music 'bout to kill you, brr, brr (Brr)
This chicken hit my phone, she said, ""Chirp, chirp""
I said, ""Hut, hut, hike your skirt, skirt""
Then go eat some worms, like the early bird
What the fuck is love? That's a dirty word
Make me fall in it, there's not a girl on Earth
Or any other planet, that's a world of hurt
And I won't buy a designer, 'cause I don't pander (Panda)
But I'm back with so many knots, I need a chiropractor (Damn)
And this the final chapter (Why?), 'cause I'm either frying after (Oh)
Or they gon' give me the needle (What?) like a vinyl scratcher (DJ)
Yeah, I'm a card, like Hallmark
At Walmart with a small cart buying wall art
And y'all who claim to be dogs aren't
No bite, like a tree, mostly just all bark, arf, arf
But y'all pickin' the wrong tree, they call me dog because I'm barking (Bar king, bark, bark, barking)
And I got a lot, yeah, like where cars park
I'd describe it as bowling (Why?) ball hard (Ball's hard)
'Cause the gutter's where my mind is and when
It's in this frame, better split like the five and the ten
'Cause without a second to spare, I'm strikin' again
And when the beat is up my alley, I go right for the pens (Pins)
The cypher begins
I'm talkin' smack like heroin, the mic's a syringe
It's like a binge, Vicodin, I would liken to tin
My mind is a recycling bin
There's no place I never been
But I never budge and I never bend
You hyperextend on me, this game's life, it depends
Like adult diapers for men
Even when I'm rappin' less stellar
It's sour grapes, I still whine, I'm the best seller (Cellar)
Like a trey deuce, spray you as these shots penetrate through Dre's booth
And go straight through your grapefruit, no escape route
So you won't leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
Your ass is grass and I am not gonna graze you
But if bars were semi-mac's, I'd be the Mad Hatter
'Cause I got so many caps, and you don't have any straps (Nah)
So you'd be a fitted (Yeah), so don't act like you fittin' to snap
Bitch, I'll pee (P) on your head like a Phillies hat (Haha)
No stoppin' me, you're on a window shopping spree
Bitch, you probably go broke at the Dollar Tree
You never buy shit, all you ever cop's a plea
You're always punkin' out like Halloween
You rather opt to flee, you need to stop it, punk
Homie, you're not a G, act like you got the pump
And you're gonna cock the heat or get the Glock and dump
Bitch, if you shot a tree, you wouldn't pop the trunk
Yeah, and I'm buddies with Alfred, we about to
Disembowel them, gut 'em and scalp 'em, yeah
This is 'bout to be the bloodiest outcome
'Cause we gon' make you bleed with every cut from this album
So I'm choppin' 'em up like Dahmer
The nut job with the nuts that are bigger than Jabba the Hutt
I'm in the cut, and I'm out for the blood
It's lookin' like it's that time of the month
Carvin' 'em up with the bars while I sharpen 'em up, dog and a mutt
I'm gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer, fuckin' phenomenal, but
Y'all'll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you don't vámonos
I keep droppin' like dominos, the formidable, abominable
Stompin' a mudhole in my comp even if it's off the top of the dome
Son 'em, get the Coppertone, I'm at the Stop and Go coppin' the Mop and Glo
Got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
You out of pocket though, like a motherfuckin' wallet stole

Wait, why'd the beat cut off?
Fuck it

Oh yeah, they're in the house
We in the Colosseum
You see I'm on the prowl
Unleash the beast then

My flow is tropical
It's from the Caribbean
Been getting bopped all over the globe
So that ya know my lyrics are frozen, so cold

I'm a let the dogs run wild
They wanna judge but I'm not on trial
I see them watching, they're so hostile
And these dogs wanna cat my style

Th-th-these dogs wanna cat my style
When I come inna di place, I say I'm a run it out
I'm a go crazy, I'm a go wild
Never got ever but they saying that I am wild

I'm an animal, unleash the beast
Tearing a riddim up by piece by piece
I can see they don't really wanna put a leash on Lesh'
But I take the lead, I'm a speak when I beast

Tearing a riddim up by piece by piece
I can see the others coming up, better stay down
Wanna hit on the spot, they better break out
It's me they wanna meet; stakeout

Haha, I find it so funny
I've got a figure besides my own money
They ain't got the stomach, they like to show tummy
I know a lot of them try, but don't, honey

We 're in the building blow the doors off
Who let the dog's out? Who- who- who-

So I'm a go crazy, mental
Bonkers, schtizo
Looney, nutty
Barmy, psycho

This is more than history
Full stop, side note
I could do this with my eyes closed
When I get an idea; lightbulb

Lightbulb, now I'm getting too claustrophobe
If they wanna bark I be giving a dog a bone
They don't start telling what really can't be told
Yeah, this riddim's hard, it'll be splittin' hard as bones

I'm a let my dogs step out of the cages
I'm on the prowl, you'll hear my growl, look at our faces

We 're in the building blow the doors off

5957,Michael Jackson,,Seeing Voices,,"

I sing of what you see and might think about 
Because of what you see.
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the ear
Not the eye traces what's on the mind

So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends.
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices.

Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone.

So..

When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you are seeing voices.

Think of them as being
As though they were seeing voices. 
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices.

So think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing, voices

Three's not a crowd all up in it, slow fire

Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (nope)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!

Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (look)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that

Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a (faggot), bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious

You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters

Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of
Everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you probably can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall... bitch!

Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

5419,Madonna,,Never Love A Stranger,,"

Love at first sight only makes you blind
First you lose your senses
Then you drop your self-defenses in time

Head over heels is a big mistake
Suddenly you're falling
And ecstasy is calling your name

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time

One goodnight kiss and it won't be long
When arms are intertwined
It's so difficult to find something wrong

One night of fun and you come undone
Anyone can hurt you
Better hold on to your virtue and run

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time

We never see the forest for the trees
We always fall in love with first impressions
Words in the night seem to vanish with the light
And you wake up and you're all alone
There's no one home

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time

Never love a stranger
Never put your heart in danger
Never fall in love with someone you don't know
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time to grow
Love takes time to grow

Day in, day out
The same old voodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out

Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out

I've seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again, nothing I can do

Like an image passing by, my love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
(See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely
(Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

I've watched you look away
Tell me is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

Like an image passing by, my love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
(See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely

Was it a dream, a lie?

Aww look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now you're two
Baby, you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

[Eminem (Kim):]
(Okay)
Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
Quit crying, bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you
Just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter Kim?
Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at, Kim
Look at your husband now!
(No!)
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?)
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk! You're never gonna get away with this!)
You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride, bitch
(No!)
Sit up front
(Well, I can't just leave Hailie alone. What if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back
Well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

I don't wanna go on

So long

You really fucked me, Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only 18
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!
(I love you!)
Oh, God, my brain is racing
(I love you!)
What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?
(No!)
There's a four-year-old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you?
(No!)
Bullshit, you bitch, don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim!
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that!)
No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you!
I swear to god, I hate you
Oh, my god, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me?
(Sorry!)
How the fuck could you do this to me?

I said get out, bitch!

Please don't do this, baby
Please I love you, look we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you
You did this to us
You did it, it's your fault
Oh, my God, I'm crackin' up
Get a grip, Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it?
(Yes!)
That was funny, wasn't it?
(Yes!)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced
(No!)
And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut
(Oh, my God!)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've... Hey! Where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim
It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! Ha! Got'cha!
(Ah!)
Ha! Go ahead, yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah, somebody help!
Don't you get it, bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! Bitch, bleed!
Bleed! Bitch, bleed! Bleed!

If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars, baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Some of you all never been down South too much...
I' gonna tell you a little story, so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields,
and it looks something like a turnip green.
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad.
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
she'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it...
Carry it home and cook it for supper, 'cause that's about all they had to eat,
But they did all right.

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman

Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack

Polk salad Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, dispiteful, straight-razor totin' woman,
Lord have mercy.

Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah

But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck

For once Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang

Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention

Did you ever fall in love
At the right time or place 
Does it always have to move
At its own kinda pace

When you're driving on cruise control
Coming up a bumpy ride 
And your heart is back in shape 
Then it hits you with no chance to hide

But don't you miss out on the way 
Don't find a reason to say

Coulda Woulda Shoulda 
But I didn't do that 
(You gotta) Give it a shot 
Better believe 
And don't say you... 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(But I didn't do that)
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back

Tell me that you played it safe
Coz you're afraid to hurt your neck
On the rollercoaster train,
Never knowing what you get

You think you wanna be cynical,
Wanna date the best in me
Giving up the greatest trash,
Who knows what it turns out to be

Don't you miss out on the way 
Don't find a reason to say 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda 
(But I didn't do that)
(you gotta) give it a shot
Better believe 
And don't say you... 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
(but I didn't do that)
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back

Ooohh

It's meant to be,
But don't think about it
Let love run free,
Coz you're on your way

Follow your heart where it's calling on you, 
Don't you say...

But I didn't do that, 
I didn't do that baby
Gotta believe it...

Coulda Woulda Shoulda 
Oh!, but I didn't do that 
You gotta give it a shot 
Better believe 
And don't say you... 

Coulda Woulda Shoulda
But I didn't do that 
Just throw in everything you've got 
Coz in love there's no holding back

Didn't do that
Coulda Woulda Shoulda
Just throw in everything you've got

Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are 
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky 
Seems to me you shine your light 
Down to me to say goodnight 
Twinkle twinkle my old friend 
Sleep is waiting round the bend 
While you travel through the Milky Way 
From afar 
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star

Raindrops on a window pane 
Stillness of a summer rain 
Silently the haze drifts through the trees 
Slowly dawn is breaking through 
Yet a morning without you

Curtains rustling in the breeze 
I'm still trapped within my dreams 
Daylight makes its way into my mind 
Coming through 
Yet another morning without you

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

Echoes of a voice I knew...

Half awake and half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All to soon 
Like an angel passing through my room

Long awaited darkness falls 
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace 
Dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined 
Playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged goodbye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All too soon 
Like an angel passing through my room

Where did she touch you,
How did if feel,
Why did you let it begin
What did she whisper and
What did it mean, and
Where do you think it will end?
How long did it last
Do you think it will stop
Did you get to try anything...new
How good was she - honestly
Where did you go and
Who made the very first move, who made the very first move,
Who made the very first move..
You don't have to sneak in the doorway
Just come on into the room
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone
And I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you

There's been no reason to move
It's been as still as a tomb
I needed you oh so badly tonight
But I guess you had better things to do

I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes
And you've still got her eyes on your mind

You swore you'd be with me at 7 o'clock
Now it's a quarter to 3
And whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me
Whatever you got and whoever it was
I guess you couldn't get it from me

I know that you love me
There's no need to talk
I see the look in your eyes and I got the proof
And there are no lies on your body
As I see you undress  ooooh

And there are no lies on your body

I just want to get at the truth

There are so many thing that I've just just gotta know
You tell me who! You tell me where! You tell me when!
But don't tell me now , I don't need any answers tonight
I just need some love so turn out the lights and
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
I'll be left in the dark again
Left in the dark again

I should have known that it was coming to this

Back porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rules
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed
With his eye all red, with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school

Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like he's better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time 'most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee

Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Armchair quarterback's always moanin'
Second guessing people all day long
Pushing, fooling and hanging on in
Always messing where they don't belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isn't it a pity that in this big city
Not a one a'little bitty man'll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong

Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me, don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

[In a time when the world of study belonged only to men, there lived a girl who dared to ask ""why""]

[Prayer]
God, our merciful father
I'm wrapped in a robe of light
Clothed in your glory
That spreads its wings over my soul
May I be worthy
Amen

There's not a morning I begin without
A thousand questions running through my mind
That I don't try to find the reason and the logic
In the world that God designed
The reason why
A bird was given wings
If not to fly and praise the sky
With every song it sings
What's right or wrong
Where I belong
Within the scheme of things
And why have eyes that see
And arms that reach
Unless you're meant to know
There's something more?
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for?
Why have the wings
Unless you're meant to fly?
And tell me please, why have a mind
If not to question why?
And tell me where
Where is it written what it is
I'm meant to be, that I can't dare
To have the chance to pick the fruit of every tree
Or have my share of every sweet-imagined possibility?
Just tell me where, tell me where?
If I were only meant to tend the nest
Then why does my imagination sail
Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale?
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine?
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine?
And tell me where, where is it written what it is
I'm meant to be, that I can't dare
To find the meanings in the mornings that I see
Or have my share of every sweet-imagined possibility?
Just tell me where - where is it written?
Tell me where
Or if it's written anywhere?

You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We're gonna taste of the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here!

The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside

But we ran our course, we pretended we're OK
Now if we jump together at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier
I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave

There's a secret that I wanna whisper in your ear
I've waited so long, too long

It's a special kind of feelin'
Something to believe in, Oh yeah

So lay back, and let it flow
Then just open up your heart and let your feelings go

That it's me that you've been seein'
Baby when you're dreamin', at night

So let your walls come down
And you'll feel my emotion

From a tear or an ocean

Whenever your hope is gone
I'll give you strength to carry on
In the darkness of the night
I will be your light
I'll give you something to hold on to
When you can't find your way

Are you feelin' what I'm feelin'

To build a wall in between us
Don't let it get you down

Like a fire burning bright
I will be your light

Whenever your hope is gone
I'll give your strength to carry on
In the darkness of the night
I will be your light
Light, shining bright, baby
I'll be the one who holds you, baby
I'll be the one who loves you, baby
Be the one who holds you, loves you, 
Baby, baby

'Cause I get wetter than umbrellas
And I'm groovier than Stella
I'm flier than a flier could you get me some repeller
I I mean I need repellent t-t-taste like watermelon
I'm buying if you selling
If you lying then I'm telling

I supersize fries and the m is for Minaj
Heard you a dopeboy and I stay around your heart
I got some good pie it could get a nigga shot
So I g-g-get more eyes than the letter with the dot

Le-le-let me let me stop
Le-le-let me make it pop
You need some good box like you playing hopscotch
So let's go and get the chalk
My Naomi Campbell walk
'Cause I'm a bad bitch like bark

Uh shawty I wanna know if you got hang time
And if you think that you could beat it by a landslide
Don't lie you could see it in my eyes
I got some good cookies and I got some good pie
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me
Pu-pu-put it on me
Could you pu-pu-put it on me

All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na......

Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na......

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

After all the wrong you've done to me

To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart, I know she'll never run away
Just can't talk no more, so I'm out the door
Talk to me, why you wanna play love games?

Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
When I loved you
Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
Empty days, empty nights
Sometimes I wonder
Could the one to save me possibly be you?
Ooooohh I was lost, I was blind till I found you
Couldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You came along, stole my heart completely
And I thought, could the one to save me possibly be you?

O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie;
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light.
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.
The angels' voices singing
Proclaim the early morning!
And children pure and happy
A-wait the break of dawn
While charity stands watching
And faithfuls wipe the door
The dark night wakes the glory bricks
And Christmas comes once more

We're in Sin City, since when did we begin to get addicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your friggidy-friends
I'm looking at your bum-stickidy-bum hun
The migidy mac's, bigidy back
Don't act wigidy-wack, you can get the figidy-finger, the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit spiggidy spin
Got a 6 o' clock craving, stop get Ciroc
It's about to be an unbelievable night
I call it surreal, Sir Mix a Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim up
Picky like I missed a spot shaving
Came to sip vodka, shit yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I poke her in the rear
But I bet if I lick her, she'll try to chase me (Haha)
What are you pit, rott, mixed oh, you just got fixed well shit then let's lip-lock
If not then trick piss off you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar
Then I'm your polar opposite dog cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit rocks
Then my sick thoughts are about to lick shots
Like this shit's hopping, and drip-dropping in chocolate-ly whip-topping
So whether you're Hip Hop, Slipknot, Big, Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (TURN UP!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin and I'm a keep on saying
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for saying
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like chopping 'til I'm dropping, still if that don't do the job of killing Shady, then the karma will, insane him
I'm as brainy Mohammad until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rocking with a sadist
So you can say this, but if the thought is entertaining
I ain't stopping to explain it
Oh my God, for real man, not again I'm shaking
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob they can slob on until it's-
Wait I just forgot what I was thinking...
What's it called again? I'm blanking
Something about the balls between my legs and I think I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging
Let's Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Got a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis, chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet, at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my names Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's skeet
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me

In 7 nights in the days Inn it's our Vegas
We roll in circles in packs... we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down n did the ALS challenge, haaaan
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like lice on a gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a Lam
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said take parvour four
Thought I said the wraith had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever...)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas

Just so you see what's on my finger
But what you saw I guess means you don't care

And I gonna approach this situation
With the utmost of precaution

I know this ain't quite what you're used to
But I really need to introduce you to my

Private dancer
Whenever you need me you know
I will answer
'Cause baby this ones for you
Oh baby this ones for you

What is a private dancer, you ask
Well you know, my status
But never mind that
Just gimme a call
I want you to dance with me

See a bad one
Gotta have one
Bring it back one, one time
My dancer keeps me low key

And I approach that situation
With the utmost of precaution
I don't wanna risk it
But a girl like you don't come too often

I know this ain't quite what you're used to
But I really need to introduce you to my

Private dancer
Whenever you need me you know
I will answer
'Cause baby this ones for you
Oh baby this ones for you

My private dancer ain't loud
Shes never allowed to leave
I keep her hip to my vibe
Like a mobile device should beep

Shes my private life
My secret, shes so discreet
Give me a call in advance
And I'll watch ya dance for me

Private dancer
Whenever you need me you know
I will answer
'Cause baby this ones for you
Oh baby this ones for you

Go put her up, put her up
And when you

So if you gotta private dancer
Go put her up, put her up

See a bad one

Goodbye my friend
This is the end

Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night
All dressed in white
Unchained and free, without me

Put on your white sombrero

Go find a sweet senorita

Proud, never bending

'Cause I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight

Baby, I'd be fallin'
You're my moonlight
Moonlight

He's so bossy
He makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When he's holding me tight
And he calls me ""Moonlight"" too

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side, high

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall in
Surely I'll do the same
Confined in the mountains halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that
You will remember me

Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light

my it's been a long long time
How am I doin',
oh well I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love,
I hope that he's doin' fine
Heard you told him, yes baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
that you told me
Well it seems like just the other day
Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away

Gotta go now,

Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town

That in time your gonna pay

Been hidin' out and layin' low
It's nothing new to me
Well, you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity

They break down the doors and they rape my rights, but
They won't judge me!
They scream and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me!
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't judge me!
'Cause I got something I've been building up inside
For so fuckin' long!

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed

They push me into a corner just to get me to fight, but
They won't judge me!
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me!
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't judge me!
'Cause I got something I've been buildin' up inside
I'm already gone!

No wow-oh
No-no
No-no-no! No-no-no!
No
No wow-oh
No-no

Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that a fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent

Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
When I loved you
Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
Empty days, empty nights
Sometimes I wonder
Could the one to save me possibly be you?
Ooooohh I was lost, I was blind till I found you
Couldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You came along, stole my heart completely
And I thought, could the one to save me possibly be you?

Watch you slither away

You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

Refresh these tired eyes

That I learned to know
Find a piece of mind I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again
And I belong again
For when you look at me
I'm everything and more that I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise
I won't be alone
We'll love and live more
Love and live forever

And change our fortunes too

Broken windows, falling skies
Baby baby, what you hiding from?
The light that followed you around
Lately, nowhere to be found

Tryna make believe that nothing's wrong

Sifting through the shattered dreams
Living in the in-between
Baby baby, it's gonna be alright (alright)

Disappointed and jerked around in this cold

Don't hesitate, I'll be right where you are

As the night time bleeds into the day
And tomorrow spills across the sky
While the sun's a harsh reminder why
We are feeling barely human

We don't know what's good for us
Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won't discover 'til we push it

I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil's got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away
Walk away, oh it grips me
Cause the devil's got my arms

We got drunk on this unholy wine
To deliver us from our old minds
A promise of a better time
'Til we're feeling barely human

We don't know what's good for us
Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won't discover 'til we push it

2034,Barbra Streisand,1964.0,If A Girl Isn't Pretty,"soundtrack: ""Funny Girl""","

[FUNNY GIRL is the life of vaudeville comedienne Fanny Brice (1891-1951),
starting in 1910. Actually the show starts after she has become a success
on stage and flashes back to her origins.  It opens in Fanny's dressing room.
She is waiting for her husband, Nick Arnstein, to return after being in prison.
She looks back to when she was a 19-year old hopeful. Her mother's poker
buddies think she's wasting her life trying to break into show business.]

[Mrs. Strakosh:]
Fanny, when people pay good money in the the-ay-ter--
especially the male element--they want something to look at!

If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City,
All she gets in life
Is pity and a pat.

[Mrs. Brice:]
Is a nose with deviation
Such a crime against the nation?
Should I throw her into jail
Or drown the cat?

[Mrs. Strakosh, O' Malley and Meeker:]
She must shine in ev'ry detail
Like a ring you're buying retail,
Be a standard size that
Fits a standard dress.

[Mrs. Strakosh:]
When a girl's incidentals
Are no bigger than two lentils

[Mrs. Strakosh, O' Malley and Meeker:]
Then to me that doesn't spell success.


Fanny auditions for Keeney's Music Hall but Keeney kicks
her out of the chorus because she doesn't look like the
others. Eddie Ryan, dance director for Keeney, agrees:

[Eddie:]
If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City,
She should dump the stage
And try another route.
Any guy who pays a quarter
For a seat just feels he oughter
See a figger that his wife can't
Substitute.

Kid, my heart ain't made of marble
But your rhythm's really horr'ble
And that map of yours just ain't no
Valentine.
Everything you got's about right,
But the damn thing don't come out right
So forget it, kid,
And just resign.

[Chorus:]
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
She should get a job,
Go get a job--
Get any job
Get a weekly pay,
'Cause if a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City,
She's a real Miss Nobody, U.S.A.

Stealing a God

But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say

Some forever not for better

With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

In the great unknown
I'll remember you.

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen'm
One time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you.

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you ?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care ?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair.

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you.

Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust ?

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.

They took a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand.

He was a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.

They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill.

They said ""Congratulation, you got what it takes""
They sent him back into the race without any brakes.

They took a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

He bought the American dream but it put him in doubt
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.

He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.

He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a swimming pool.

They took a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.

He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.

His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.

They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about.

He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire.

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That's what they did.

There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you

Camping out all night on the veranda
Walking in the streets down by the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill the like to send you

There's mills inside the minds of crazy faces
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases
There is always one more notch in four more aces

Playing around with some sweet sinorita
Into her dark chamber she will greet you
In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you
Billy, and you're going all alone

So sleep with one eye open, when you wander
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun

There's always another stranger sneaking glances
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul

The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
So they've hired mister Garrett, he'll force you to slow down

To be hunted by the man who was your friend

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be so"" oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

I can feel your eyes in the back of my head
Burning, burning, burning
Floating through the room as the hairs on my arms are
Rising, rising, rising
I'm chemically drawn closer to you
Eyes wide, eyes wide open
Will you be my future or just an escape?
Love me, love me, love me

You'll never get to heaven on a night like this

Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are

Pulling at my t-shirt, your hands everywhere
Rising, rising, rising
As you trip and fall, dragging me up the stairs
What's your, what's your name, now?

You try to get to heaven on a night like this
But you, you never get to heaven on a night like this

Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with

The lights, the lights, the lights
A blinding look from me to you
And I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to heaven

Now I finally know for sure
And I'm overwhelmed with happiness
So blessed to hold you close

With all the future has so much for you in store
Who could ever love you more?

The nearest thing to heaven,
You're my angel from above
Only God creates such perfect looooove

When you smile at me, I cry
And to save your life I'll die
With a romance that is pure heart,
You are my dearest part 
Whatever it requires, 
I live for your desires
Forget my own, needs will come before
Who could ever love you more?

Well there is nothing you could ever do,
To make me stop, loving you
And every breath I take, 
Is always for your sake
You sleep inside my dreams and know for sure

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness

Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya

How come you never show it? All this love you speak of

But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer (summer)

If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?""

So she said, ""That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone in the summer.""

Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out

Nowhere to go but hysterical.

Was born to be an arsonist.
Just one spark and it's lit,
But I'mma still get dark on this shit.
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch.

War machine? But you've forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe.
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu.
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruining your career.

But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run
I just rewind clocks.
Forever young.
Make time stop.
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
'Til the pine box. Bitch, fuck you!

Whenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile
I ask you to be my Clementine

You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle
Highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

I feel so romantic. Can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (ooh I like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year it's so fashionable,

I feel like dancing in the rain,
Can I have a volunteer?
Just keep right on dancing
What a damn jolly good idea -

It's such a jollification as a matter of fact, so très charmant, my dear

Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea reminiscing every night (shine on silvery moonlight)
Meantime (in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my Valentine

You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino

Get a new facial
Start a sensational

Seaside rendezvous — so adorable,
Seaside rendezvous — ooh hoo
Seaside rendezvous — give us a kiss

Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings

Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

If all our life is but a dream
Fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me

And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along
In storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes, and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page
It's chasin' off the days
Look back at both feet
And that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me

Through playful lips made of yarn
That fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down

Sugarcane in the easy mornin'
Weathervanes my one and lonely

She won't help the hungry once a month at your tombolas
She'll simply take control as you disappear

Shove a fuckin' Tonka truck up a little kid's butthole

I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her layin' in a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my Spider-Man mask, man

Well, whether there was a murder, I don't know, I wasn't there
I was busy visiting a friend in jail
There were just two women on the scene at the time
Neither one of 'em saw a thing, both of 'em were wearing veils
They said it was a natural situation
He reached too high and tumbled back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to people on your way up
""You might meet 'em again on your way back down""

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

He had a brother named Paul hang out at the cafe royal
Where Miss Dolly plays and the reviews have been mixed
Well, he's pretty to look at looking for someone to throw the book at
But you know that he drinks and drinks, can't be fixed
Sing me one more song about your summer romance, I know
You don't know ""Motherless Children"", sing me the one about you and Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion where conformity's a fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

Dr. Silver Spoon from the empress ballroom
He's a retired businessman who feeds off everyone he's touched
Gives money to the church and foundations for research
He's not someone you can play around with too much
But then there's Rosetta Blake who's been to both sides of the lake
She's rough to look at but she's righteously fit
She'll feed you coconut bread and spiced buns in bed
You won't have to worry 'bout sleeping face down with your head in the plate

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

You'll arrange to see your man tonight
Who tells you some secret things you think might open some doors
How to enter the gates of paradise, no not really
More like how to go crazy from carrying a burden that's never meant to be yours
From the stage they'll be doing the bumps and the grinds
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin and build big universities to study in
And sing Amazing Grace all the way to the Swiss Bank

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

They got some serious people out there, man
They can ring your bell and show you how to hold your tongue
They don't come to party, man
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don't believe in mercy
And judgment on them is something you'll never see
They can put your face on a postage stamp
Turn your home into an armed camp anyway they want you
That's the way you'll be

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

Yes, I loved him too
I still see him in my mind climbing up that hill
Or was it a wall, I don't recall
It don't matter at all and it never will
Ain't nothing left here partner
Just the dust of fools that have left their mark in spades
From now on this will be where you're from
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come
Feel that hot iron glowing now as you raise the shades

But it's too late to bring him back
Too late, too late, too late, too late, too late to bring him back

And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie:
One entered in then for to see,
And found the Babe in poverty:
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done girl

2855,Bob Dylan,2006.0,Workingman's Blues #2,"""Modern Times""","

There's an evening haze settling over town 
Starlight by the edge of the creek 
The buying power of the proletariat's gone down 
Money's getting shallow and weak 
Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory 
It's a new path that we trod 
They say low wages are a reality 
If we want to compete abroad 

My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf 
Come sit down on my knee 
You are dearer to me than myself 
As you yourself can see 
While I'm listening to the steel rails hum 
Got both eyes tight shut 
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from 
Creeping it's way into my gut 

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind 
Bring me my boots and shoes 
You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline 
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 

Well, I'm sailing on back, ready for the long haul 
Tossed by the winds and the seas 
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall 
I'll sell them to their enemies 
I'm trying to feed my soul with thought 
Going to sleep off the rest of the day 
Sometimes no one wants what we got 
Sometimes you can't give it away 

Now the place is ringed with countless foes 
Some of them may be deaf and dumb 
No man, no woman knows 
The hour that sorrow will come 
In the dark I hear the night birds call 
I can feel a lover's breath 
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall 
Sleep is like a temporary death 

Well, they burned my barn, and they stole my horse 
I can't save a dime 
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced 
Into a life of continual crime 
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking 
How I wish you were here to see 
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking 
That you have forgotten me? 

Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret 
They waste your nights and days 
Them I will forget 
But you I'll remember always 
Old memories of you to me have clung 
You've wounded me with your words 
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue 
It's all true, everything you've heard 

In you, my friend, I find no blame 
Wanna look in my eyes, please do 
No one can ever claim 
That I took up arms against you 
All across the peaceful sacred fields 
They will lay you low 
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel 
I say it so it must be so 

Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue 
Gonna give you another chance 
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you 
To lead me off in a cheerful dance 
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife 
I can live on rice and beans 
Some people never worked a day in their life 
Don't know what work even means.

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring

So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a hoe

Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed

Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon

Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neuman mad cerebral

And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine

This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here letting the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!

With a big boquet of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground.

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time

Slipping through my fingers...

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
There ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

Met you out on Broadway
On the hottest night in town
We arrived solo
But we were being chased around
Saw you being caught up by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of ya'll
Said ""I'm leaving, do you wanna go?""

'Cause
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

I don't know if you remember this
But I was out of town
Flew in on a 3AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop
Hit the set
You ain't headed that way
I can guarantee you that

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's about to go down
I'll be the one with the level head

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl (okay)
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay)

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's about to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get my lighter, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Oh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to
Wait

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
There ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

It's like this and like that and like this
It's like this and like that and like this

I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mind-state
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream ""I'm still alive!""
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker

It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both

I tried and tried to let you know
I love you but I'm letting go
It may not last but I don't know
Just don't know

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep

Built a wall around my heart
I’ll never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Though we have not hit the ground
It doesn't mean we're not still falling,
Oh I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame, I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then the fact remains

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

He wanted her.
She'd never tell.
Secretly she wanted him as well.
And all of her friends stuck up their nose.
They had a problem with his baggy clothes.

He was a skater boy.
She said, ""See ya later, boy.""
He wasn't good enough for her.
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space.
She needed to come back down to earth.

Five years from now, she sits at home feeding the baby.
She's all alone.

Skater boy rockin' up MTV.
She calls up her friends.
They already know.
And they've all got tickets to see his show.
She tags along,
Stands in the crowd,
Looks up at the man that she turned down.

He was a skater boy.

He wasn't good enough for her.
Now he's a superstar
Slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Too bad that you couldn't see...
See the man that boy could be.
There is more than meets the eye,
I see the soul that is inside.

He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl.
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love.
Haven't you heard how we rock each other's world?

I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know.

Once I hoped
To seek the new and unknown
This planet's overrun
There's nothing left for you or for me
Don't give in, we can
Walk through the fields
And feeling nature's glow
But all the land is owned
There's none left for you or for me

Who will win?
'Cause I concede

Free me
Free me
Free me from this world
I don't belong here
It was a mistake imprisoning my soul
Can you free me
Free me from this world

A world lush in bloom
With rivers running wild
They'll be re-routed South
With none left for you or for me
Don't give in
Hear the engines roar
And save our crops from drought
But when the black gold's in doubt
There's none left for you or for me

Fuse helium-3
Our last hope

Free me

Free me from this world

Running around in circles feeling caged
By endless rules
Can you free me, free me from this world

Help me to face what lies ahead?

In a state, losing weight,

To where no-one else would dare to bother us.

If everybody took a serious view of life,

And they come home smelling like their ex-girlfriends.

My Cinderella-story scene.

Lift up your head
Wash off your mascara
Here take my Kleenex
Wipe that lipstick away
Show me your face clean as the morning
I know things were bad
But now they're okay

Suddenly Seymour is here to provide you
with sweet understanding
Seymour's your friend

Nobody ever treated me kindly
Daddy left early
Mama was poor
I'd meet a man
And I'd follow him blindly
He'd snap his fingers
Me, I'd say, ""Sure""

He purified me (He purified you)

Showed me I can (Yes, you can)

With sweet understanding

Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat

Still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living?

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind

And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face

Well, you're a long walk from my street
And I'm dying in this summer heat
I hope like hell you're waiting, waiting

Everybody's living like they're crazy in love
I'm a dizzy mess and everything is so above me
From the floor I found the life I lead today

Well they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for the week
They can't make, make, make me forget the weather
If I never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time, then we said goodbye to the beach
(We were showing off, we were showing off our teeth)

So make one last call back home
'Cause tonight we go it alone
And I hope that you know I'm waiting, waiting...

Of all your lying, (Tell me do you feel me, listen can you hear it?)

The answer's in the smile, and I'm coming clean
Just give me something, (Tell me do you feel me, listen can you hear it?)

Make a wish on our sorry little hearts
Have a smoke, pour a drink, steal a kiss in the dark
Fingernails on my skin like the teeth of a shark
I'm intoxicated by the lie

In the chill of your stare I am painfully lost
Like a deer in the lights of an oncoming bus
For the thrill of your touch I will shamefully lust
As you tell me we're nothing but trouble

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war

We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all

Fail-safe trigger, lock-down call
Wipe the dry clean-slate, quick, sound the alarm
No escape from the truth and the weight of it all
I am caught in the web of a lie

And the bitch of it all is that I'm running from
The desire of the people to whom I belong
At the end of the day you can tell me I'm wrong
'Cause you went to all of this trouble

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war

[Ed Sheeran:]
Yeah I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rapping like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just being on the rich list
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is going numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy, and you know nothing about my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you Remember The Name
And if you thought I was good well then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent ""In Da Club""

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

[Eminem:]
Hey, hey, hey
I can still remember (What?)
Tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL, I climbed the Billboard charts
To the top until as fate would have it (Yeah)
Became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time'll tell (What?) If I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) Put Nine Inch Nails (Where?)
In my eye-lids now (What?) I'm seeing diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (Yeah) Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if ands or butts, are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me, 'cause you're only fuckin' living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my death bed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So, why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

[Ed Sheeran and Eminem:]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

[50 Cent:]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You could find me in my whip rockin my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shining, wrist with the rocks on it
Buscemi's the locks on it
Everything my voice on, the shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit, and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch we be ballin' out, the king bringing 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout the shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over, 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid

To Love While Making Love 
Sola en mi silencio andaba en la ciudad
El calor de tu mirada me hizo despertar
De ese largo sueno de esa soledad
Caminar junto a tu lado era natural

Alone in my silence walking in the city 
The warmth of your look awaken me 
From this large dream from this solitude 
Walking with you at my side was natural
Contigo me escape del mundo a otra dimension
En tus brazos yo sentia que perdia la razon
El miedo de entregarme con tu piel se me borro 
Y en mi corazon por ti se despertaba el amor
Como despierta una flor 
Cuando el viento la acaricia 
Y se entrega ante el calor

With you I left the world for another dimension 
In your arms I felt I lost my mind 
The fear to open myself to you left 
And in my heart the love for you awaken 
Like a flower awakens 
When the wind caresses it 
And the warmth goes in
Se despertaba el amor
con esta loca pasion
junto a ti descubro lo que es
Amar haciendo el amor

Love is awaking 
With this crazy passion 
I'm joining you to discover what it is 
To Love While Making Love
Fuimos descubriendo secretos de los dos
Y asi entre risa y lagrimas el sol nos
encontro

Let's run away discovering secrets from each other 
And between laughs and tears the sun 
Meets us
Somos dos extranos que el cielo confeso

We are two strangers that Heaven confess
Amantes que el destino sedujo sin control

Lovers that destiny seduces without any control
Como un dia sone
Cuando el sentimiento es tan profundo entre el hombre y la mujer
Cuando es de verdad cuando sientes mas
y el deseo llega mas adentro.

Like a daydream 
When the feeling is so deep between the man and the woman 
When it's the truth when you feel it more 
And the crave hits deeper

And mark a place in time for every chance you took?

Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not if I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy

My Brave Face.
I've Been Living In Style
Unaccustomed As I Am To The Luxury Life.
I've Been Hitting The Town And It Didn't Hit Back.

I've Been Doing The Rounds
Unaccustomed As I Am To The Time On My Hands.
Now I Don't Have To Tell Anybody When I'm Gonna Get Back.

Ever Since You Went Away I've Had This Sentimental
Inclination Not To Change A Single Thing.
As I Pull The Sheets Back On The Bed I Want To Go Bury My Head
In Your Pillow.

Now That I'm Alone Again, I Can't Stop Breaking Down Again,
The Simplest Things Set Me Off Again
And Take Me To That Place
Where I Can't Find My Brave Face
Where I Can't Find My Brave Face
My Brave, My Brave, My Brave Face.

I've Been Living A Lie
Unaccustomed As I Am
To The Work Of A Housewife,
I've Been Breaking Up
Dirty Dishes And Throwing Them Away.

Ever Since You Left I Have Been Trying To
Compose A ""Baby Will You Please Come Home"" Note
Meant For You.
As I Clear Away Another
Untouched Tv Dinner
From The Table I Laid For Two.

Now That I'm Alone Again
I Can't Stop Breaking Down Again,
The Simplest Things Set Me Off Again
And Take Me To That Place
Where I Can't Find My Brave Face,
Where I Can't Find My Brave Face,
My Brave, My Brave, My Brave Face.
My Brave Face.

4773,Eminem,,I Remember (Everlast Diss),,"

Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember

There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singing the blues like there was no tomorrow
Left his boys in the House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughing when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do

Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard ""The Knack""
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhyming, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or something
I'm sorry man, I wasn't trying to steal your light or nothing
But you're a homosexual, white rapping Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a Muslim too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So every time I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

You fuckin' punk pussy, you fucking faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a .380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song, don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt

Mmm. . .
One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy
But all I do is cry, cry
No more laughter
(Oh I should be happy)
Oh why did he go
I only know that since he left
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
(I should be happy)
'Cause I still love him so
I end each day the way I started
Crying my heart out
(Start and end each day crying)
One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man
(One less man)
To pick up after
No more laughter, no more laughter
Since he went away
(Since he went away)
Since he went away
Mmm... a chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there' s no one there
To hold you tight and no one there
You can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing ever gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
And when it ends, it ends in tears
So darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
Oh, I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh please, be there still in love with me
One less bell to answer
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
One less egg to fry
(I got one less man)
To pick up after
(No more laughter)
No more laughter
No more laughter...
Since he went away
(Since he went away)
Since he went away...
All I do is cry...

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

I can't help falling in love

Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

You can sing most anything

'Round and 'round and 'round you go

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there

Will end up coming back to you

You remind me what they said

Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Damn!)
Thanks a lot.. next semester, I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
and told him to change the grade on the paper (Now!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Served the bartender, then walked out with a tip cup
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they're screamin at me: ""LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her (Here mom!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!) YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulleproof vest on and tap myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steamin mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Ask him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad

Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

Beside the victory

Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
It seems plain to me

I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it

I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
Used to always have my back

So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep
You're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiend's how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D
I thought you loved me, bitch, you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
Fuck all you

Fuckin' bitch
We're done

3406,Depeche Mode,,Coming Back To You,,"

Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you

Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Though the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you

And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you

There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you

Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend
To give me comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you

Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
Since that day he ain't been the same

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again

I've got fire water right on my breath
And the doctor warned me I might catch a death
Said, ""You can make it in your disguise
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes""

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
He got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again

Now if he says that he's afraid
Take him at his word
And for the price that the poor boy has paid
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh

Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry
Fancy people go driftin' by
The moment of truth is right at hand
Just one more nightmare you can stand

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again, hmm hmm

You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm
Please, don't make him stop, hmm hmm
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm
Let him start all over again

Pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock'n'roll baby
She's the apple of my eye, 'cause

Flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping
The cats are going wild
The music really sends me
I dig that crazy style 'cause

Gonna kick off my shoes
Roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock'n'roll baby
Pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left
I shuffle to the right
I'm gonna rock'n'roll

So suddenly, so strange
Life wakes you up, things change
I've done my best, I've served my call
I thought I had it all

So suddenly, so strong
My prejudice was gone
You needed me, I found my place

Now the greatest reward
Is the light in your eyes
The sound of your voice
And the touch of your hand
You made me who I am

You trusted me to grow
I gave my heart to show
There's nothing else I cherish more
I stand by you for sure

And said that way down on Highway 61

Well Mack the finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmmm you're right
Let me tell second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Yo
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight
Yo

I'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you, non-stop
I walk up on ya, ""Well, hello Tonya""
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
C'mon

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like ""Hello, my love""
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah

I know
Same song and dance

I live on a street named after a Saint
Women in the churches wear powder and paint
Where the Jews, and the Catholics, and the Muslims all pray
I can tell a Proddie from a mile away
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Reed indeed
Give me that old-time religion, it's just what I need

For thine is the kingdom, the power, the glory
Go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story
Tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone
In the mystic hours when a person's alone
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, godspeed
Thump on the Bible, and proclaim a creed

You won't amount to much, the people all said
'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head
Never pandered, never acted proud
Never took off my shoes, threw 'em in the crowd
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, goodnight
Put a jewel in your crown and I put out the lights

They threw everything at me, everything in the book
I had nothing to fight with but a butcher's hook
They had no pity, they never lend a hand
I can't sing a song that I don't understand
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, good luck
I can't play the record 'cause my needle got stuck

Transparent woman in a transparent dress
Suits you well, I must confess
I'll break open your grapes, I'll suck out the juice
I need you like my head needs a noose
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long
I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong

God be with you, brother dear
If you don't mind me asking what brings you here?
Oh, nothing much, I'm just looking for the man
Came to see where he's lying in this lost land
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, and everything within ya
Can't you hear me calling from down in Virginia?

Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said ""I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello, hi!
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin

I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat-lined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – listen
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, 'cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
""Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!""
""It's probably AIDS!"" ""Forget it then.""
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
""Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.""
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

I guess so

Ok!

It had to be you
Person call it faith
It had to be you

I wondered around, finally found somebody who
somebody who
somebody who

For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still

It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you

Just me and you
No one but you

It had to be you

It had to be you

It had to be you

Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold

Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you 
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me 

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
(It's one of those kinda nights)

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""
She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (since an addy)
She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me
It's one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like ""Oh, my God, my whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said ""Oh, my God, you know my songs, that's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on?"" (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
She said ""No, I'm bi""
She said ""Are you drunk?"", I said ""No, I'm high""
I'm checkin' out the chick, she said ""So am I""
What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl where the rest of that promethazine at
She said cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe and bring the lean back
Then I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda—

OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said ""Out""
I said I'm a candle, I go out if you blow on me
Walk her out to the parkin' lot
Here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said ""Let's pull over""
She said ""No problemo"", windows are dark tint
Roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Getting head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi
I'm comin', you're going

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me

Ooh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say, ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back

Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now

Something in the things she shows me

And nobody's ever wrong
I guess we got to agree to disagree
Even if we're singing the same song
You can't try to change a life that don't want to be changed
If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey 

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
And we'll be alright
Alright

Everybody longs for success, whatever that is
The whole world's longing for each his own
It's a place where the truth stays in the light
Cause nobody ever lies
And we follow our hearts into the night
Wake up thankful to be alive
You can't try to save a life that don't want to be saved
If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast

Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come

And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just died, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back

As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn't (A) mean and (B) just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things

Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out

Things we lost to the flames
Things we'll never see again
All that we have amassed
Sits before us, shattered into ash

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire

We sat and made a list
Of all the things that we had
Down the backs of table tops
Ticket stubs and your diaries

I read them all one day
When loneliness came and you were away
Oh they told me nothing new,
But I love to read the words you use

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire

I was the match and you were the rock
Maybe we started this fire
We sat apart and watched
All we had burned on the pyre

(You said) we were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now
(You said) we were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire

Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again

Tenderly they turned to dust all that I adored

2441,Barbra Streisand,2009.0,Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most,"""Love Is The Answer""","

Once I was a sentimental thing;
Threw my heart away each spring.
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance.
Promised my first dance to winter.
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling.

Spring this year has got me feeling
Like a horse that never left the post.
I lie in my room
Staring up at the ceiling.
Spring can really hang you up the most.

Morning's kiss wakes trees and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast.
But I walk in the park
Just to kill the lonely hours.
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All afternoon the birds twitter-twitt.
I know the tune. This is love, this is it.
Heard it before
And don't I know the score.
And I've decided that spring is a bore.

Love seems sure around the new year.
Now it's April. Love is just a ghost.
Spring arrived on time,
Only what became of you, dear?
Spring can really hang you up the most.
Spring can really hang you up the most.

Love came my way. I thought it would last.
We had our day, now it's all in the past.
Spring came along, a season of song,
Full of sweet promise
But something went wrong.

Doctors once prescribed a tonic.
Sulfur and molasses was the dose.
Didn't help one bit.
My condition must be chronic.
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All alone, the party is over.
Old man winter was a gracious host.
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover,
Spring can really hang you up the most.

7250,Sam Smith,,"Writing's On The Wall(from ""Spectre"" soundtrack)",,"

I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay

I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in running
This is something I gotta face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

The writing's on the wall

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

America, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold
(Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide reaching for a T-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?

I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life
And now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby—ooh, baby!—look at my sales

Let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half, I
Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it!"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now
It's

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke
Tightening around my throat
Watching me while I write this
Like I don't like this
Nope

All I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem
In Harlem
Only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flak
From these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper
To smack a bitch, or say ""faggot""

Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild
The motherfuckin' spokesman now for

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor
In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy

Fuck you, Ms. Cheney
Fuck you, Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you

I'm just playin', America, you know, I love you

Love is lovelier
The second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think, perhaps, that love like youth
Is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable
The second time you fall
Like a friendly home, the second time you call
Who can say, what led us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'd bet
Love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met
The second time around

Oh sister when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.

Oh sister am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection ?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction ?

We grew up together 
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved.

Oh sister when I come to knock on your door
Don't turn away you'll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow.

Gone and left me here 
To weep my tears into the stream

And say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a breakin' and a makin' a moan
Murmur to the night
To hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing here and crying all alone

Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)

They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whomsoever shall be found

Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb

Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

4772,Eminem,,I Need A Doctor,,"

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me when everyone was telling
You don't sign me, everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm crying in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke

Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was riding to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fucking back-stabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Making wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they'll scream, ""Dre, don't leave us like that man!"" 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time

An' everybody warms themselves to a different fire
An' sometimes we get burned, you'd think sometime we'd learn
The one you love is the one that should take you higher
You ain't got no one, you better go back out and find her

Just like children hidin' in a closet, can't tell what's goin' on outside
Sometimes, we're so far off the beaten track, we get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick, or some words of wit, a hidden hand up a sleeve

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you

Ain’t gonna waste my hate
Ain’t gonna waste my hate on you
I think I’ll keep it for myself

Ain’t gonna give no more
Ain’t got the time to help you score
I think it’s time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you’re worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell’s my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don’t waste, waste your breath
And I won’t waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think I’ll keep it for myself

Why must I love a heartless woman
Who never knows the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on

I climb the stairs up to my room
But no-one greets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on

These walls will hide me when I cry
I hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope has gone
Just call me lonesome from now on

Just call me lonesome from now on

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
I shall walk

The trail is dusty
And my road it might be rough
But the better roads are waiting
And boys it ain't far off

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
We shall walk

I walked down by the river
I turned my head up high
I saw that silver linin'
That was hangin' in the sky

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
We shall walk

The evenin' dusk was rollin'
I was walking down the track
There was a one-way wind a-blowin'
And it was blowin' at my back

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
We shall walk

The gravel road is bumpy
It's a hard road to ride
But there's a clearer road a-waitin'
With the cinders on the side

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
We shall walk

That evening train was rollin'
The hummin' of its wheels
My eyes they saw a better day
As I looked across the fields

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
We shall walk

The trail is dusty
The road it might be rough
But the good road is a-waitin'
And boys it ain't far off

Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
We shall walk

Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,

That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager

I don't care a jack, or about what cha' do, 
Just put ya dime on the line baby, cos i own you, 

[CHORUS]
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
One blow to the head is all you need
Cheater... 

[VERSE 2]
Now you better go and get yourself some attitude!
I know ya name and the game is I own you 
Ya, tellin' me that ya comin to a compramise 
Ya smilin at me while, ya stealin right before my eyes 

[CHORUS]
Somebody said, give up instead on how ya feel, 
One blow to the head is all ya need,

[BRIDGE]
I hurt my backbone baby,
I start to give it up,
Life is an aggrovator,
Sometimes I part it up,
I broke my radiator,
I'm indestructible,
I pray to leave my body,
Don't you ever call!

[VERSE 3]
I don't care a jack, or about what you do 
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you 
Cheater...

Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
One blow to the head is all you need,

I am bound to you with a tie that we cannot break
With a night that we can't replace
I'm lost but found with you in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase

I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think, and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real

So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

Mm, in another time
And in another place

So lie to me tonight and pretend 'til the morning light
And imagine that you are mine
'Cause when the sun will rise with the truth coming out your eyes
We'll be good in another life

I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think, and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend is real

So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

Feels like something's special but it never felt like love
Wonder what we could be living in another life
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above

So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

Oh, yeah

Mem'ries,
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures,
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we? Could we?
Mem'ries, may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember...
The way we were...
The way we were...

First, see the city skylights shining from my room
You're such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon's reflection when
It's passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say, ""It's been a long time.""
I say, ""OK-K-K, don't worry, I got you.""
Do you say ""How 'bout some foreplay?""?
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do you say ""Play some slow ones""?
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye, too
To love you gently

Ooh, let me love you gently
Lay back, relax, girl I'ma be
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
'Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
(Gonna love you baby, gentle with you baby, ooh ooh)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

See, I know just when to finish and I know just when to start
And I'll be loving your reaction every time I hit that spot (gently)
But it's soft like leather (gently), but the top is hard (gently)
Whisper your pleasures (gently), then I'll do my job
Invigorating, intense, girl, let me do what I do
I don't know what's echoing louder, the music or you (gently)
I ain't close to be done yet (gently), but you're getting real warm (gently)
Like the calm of the thunder (gently), right after the storm
Do you say, you say, do you say it, girl?
I'm, gonna push it to the limit, ooh
(It's yours, it's yours)
See, second place or win the race, I'm gonna be your number one
('Til the sun shines)
Whoa, here comes the sun (forever more)
Let's try and taste the moon again, forever more

Let me love you gently
That's the sound of love, ripping shades off the wall
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Ooh, this might not be in the bedroom
But I'm gonna love you, girl, gently
Gonna love you gently, ooh
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Let me touch you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently (ah babe, ah baby)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock

Ooh, can you feel me, girl?
Aye, uh huh
We don't need no room
All we need is me and you, aye
Wanna love you

2087,Barbra Streisand,1966.0,The Minute Waltz,"""Color Me Barbra""","

I have got a minute, just a little minute,
I have only got a minute, just minute,
I have only got a minute that is all the time
I have to sing this tiny minute waltz
It isn't easy but I'll try it
Than I gotta say goodbye
But first I take a minute
And put in it every note that Chopin wrote
and I shall sing the little minute waltz
And hope that I can sing with no faults
and though it's difficult
I'll give it every gust of air I got within in my body
Hope that my performance will be very shiny
Singing every note will not do wonders for my throat
I probably will end up hoarse
Of course I will have done it
And a will for that I made
That what I want is not the money
but the satisfaction that I get
from winning money on this silly kind of bet
Though this kind of solo wasn't his intention
Chopin isn't here to make an intervention
So with your permission and no intermission
I will sing each note that that composer wrote
as you can hear my trilling isn't very thrilling
but no one can say I wasn't very willing
to attempt a thing that's not been done
and just for fun to sing the minute waltz
As I sing the seconds fly, oh too soon the minute waltzes by
And now I ask you where am I halfway through the tune
and I'm falling  far behind
I have less than 30 seconds
less than 30 seconds
less than 30
less than half a minute
I have less than 30 seconds
I have less than half a minute
to complete this little minute waltz
And every note that's its score
While the sands of time I know are pouring
Let me win my bet and I'll run with the money
Down to some drug store whare I will buy a honey
Or a trophy for myself to put upon a shelf to show the world I've won
Oh the second hand is rushing round the dial
And though I'd like to end this torture with a smile
Unless someone knows how to stop the clock
you gonna see me cry before I said goodbye
Eight little measures to complete this song
But I'm afraid my little lungs will burst before to long if
Only I can last the scale
I won't have failed to sing the minute waltz!

Check it out
Hey Kyu!

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
'Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been troubled enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're stepping on turf, Kyu

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Every day in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheap
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is OK (It's OK)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)

Uh, it's OK, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's OK, it's alright, I can't sleep

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you'll grow out of
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

When I was a little bitty boy
Sittin' on my papa's knee
I still remember every word my papa said to me
Now boy if you ever meet
A pretty woman walking down the street

You'd better
Stop real still, look both ways
Listen or you'll get in trouble

When you see her go struttin' by
Giving you that evil eye
And she's got a kind of dreamy look
Just enough to get you shook
Now boy don't you lose your head
You pay attention what your papa said

You'd better
Stop real still, look both ways
Listen or you'll get in trouble

All right !

She'll drive you crazy with the way she walks
She'll drive you crazy with the way she talks
And you'll think you're gonna lose your mind
'cause that pretty woman looks so fine
And the very first thing you'll know
You'll be tellin' her you love her so

You'd better stop real still

Standing on the water, casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with truth so far off, what good will it do.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care ? Ain't nobody there would want marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain 
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion
Move on
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing
Move on
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning
Move on
How I treasure every minute
Being part of it, being in it
With the urge to move on

I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer
To all the questions why
What really makes the difference
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive

Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)

Being part of it (la la la la)
Being in it (la la la la)
With the urge to move on

The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me
I see it and I hear it
But how can I explain
The wonder of the moment
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)
Move on (la la la la-la)
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)

For your anger to end
Oh father, I have sinned

Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay, I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say ""whore"", Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it, now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got
Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot

Slim Shady, artful dodger

(I love you) I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do

Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?

And why I'm by myself

2718,Bob Dylan,1978.0,We Better Talk This Over,"""Street Legal""","

I think we better talk this over
Maybe when we both get sober
You'll understand I'm only a man
Doing the best that I can.

This situation can only get rougher
Why should we needlesly suffer ?
Let's call it a day go our own different way
Before we decay.

You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.

I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You have been two-faced, you been double-dealing
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance.

Oh child, why you wanna hurt me ?
I'm exiled you can't convert me
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed.

You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone
Somewhere in the univers there's a place that you can call home.

I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh.

But I don't think it's liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clapping
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
Beneath the bed where we slept.
Don't think of me and fantasize of what we never had
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad
Why should we got on watching each other through a telescope ?
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.

Oh babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That we've both gone beyond.

2957,Bob Dylan,,Abandoned Love,,"

I can hear the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still

I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?

Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes
But me, I can't cover what I am
Wherever the children go I'll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I'm not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?

I've given up the game, I've got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can't be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange

One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it
"
1565,Bastille,,Overload,,"

Strange fear I ain't felt for years
The boy's coming and I'm close to tears
I can't let go of you now

Imagination's playing round for free
In my world I take him out for tea
Oh my God, can't say no

Skipping school, go walk for air
I just had to get out of bed
I'm on overload in my head

Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation

Life is a dream, time does come true
And in my sleep I think of you
Feather bed by myself

Basically probability
Says that fate's come side with me
It's been so long on my shelf

Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation

The tension is incredible, boy I'm in charge
You know how I feel for you
Will you stop, or will you just keep going
Please don't say no, no, no, no

Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation
Train comes I don't know its destination
It's a one-way ticket to a madman's situation

Wow look out.)

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Beyond here lies nothin'

Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours

Down every street there's a window
And every window's made of glass
We'll keep on lovin' pretty baby
For as long as love will last

Her eyes tell the story so well
She tries hard to hide
So little expected
Too often neglected,
A woman stripped of her pride

Always so careful not to cry
Not till I fall asleep
And there in the silence
She lies with a tear on her cheek

The thought comes to mind
That I've failed somehow
For things I can't quite recall

A man without love is only half a man
But a woman is nothing at all

He's there to pick me up

You only get one chance

And do the best you can 
Once a day goes by 
You never get it back 
So live every minute

Would come along to steal my heart

And the magic in the making

This world's waited long enough

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it

Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don't change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon.

Now there's a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who gonna take away his license to kill ?

Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars.

Now, there's a woman on my block 
She just sit there facing the hill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill ?

Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believe are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies.

But there's a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill ?

Ya may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
'Til your error you clearly learn.

Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way.

Now, there's a woman on my blocks
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who gonna take away his license to kill ?

Said I was doing dumb shit all the time
'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all

I heard it was the wrong things I get right
I'm blaming all the monsters in my mind
With stories from outside these prison walls

'Cause even if we're hopeless
We know that this will hurt
Tomorrow is just a blur
And they can't control

Yet all we need

Said I wanna run but I'm terrified
Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights
So you and me go falling through the dark

Told me to be someone that I like
Instead of being someone in their eyes
Your battle scars make you look like a star

'Cause even if we're hopeless
We know that this will hurt

Memory's bliss

The candle plays the hourglass
The days go and all I do is
Think of you and wonder where you are at night
I remember everything
Every smile, and even all the reasons why you say
I pushed you out of my life

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Destiny is everything
Reality's replaced you with
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life)
Bet you say that I don't care
I bet you say that I don't even think of you
But God knows how wrong you are
Baby, will you be there when the morning comes?
(Baby, will you be there?)
Just give me time (just give me time)
To fix my life (to fix my life baby)
Baby, will you be there when I open my eyes?
After all the time I've spent, wishing

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you

Sadness that overwhelmed me
My mind flies and carelessly
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now
I guess that's just the way it goes
Forever's gone so now I must
Place you with all the things that I can never have

Baby you set me
Baby you set me
Set adrift on memory's bliss
Baby you set me

So come on now

Could I wake up next to you
When it's hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines

Hey....

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

Flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1

Just so you don't die alone

I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone

Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back

And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I

Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""Honey, I'm back""

625,Alec Benjamin,,Balancing Game (Demo),,"

You can't have glory without the pain
You can't have freedom without the chains
It's a fragile existence, a delicate system
This life is a balancing game

I thought I could tip the scales, cheat the game
Have the sun without the rain
Take your love
And not exchange my heart for yours
I guess that it's me to blame

So this is what I found
From the bridges I burned down
That it all comes back around
Now I know

You can't have glory without the pain
You can't have freedom without the chains
It's a fragile existence, a delicate system
This life is a balancing game

So then I called you up to make amends
Said, ""Take me back""
And you said, ""Yes""
But now I know just how it ends
You played the game, like me, it was all pretend

So this is what I've learnt
You can't take and not return
Because one day you'll get burned, and now I know

You can't have glory without the pain
You can't have freedom without the chains
It's a fragile existence, a delicate system

Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, ""Hi
I got a little place nearby
Wanna go?""
I should have said, ""No

2973,Bob Dylan,,Dreamin' Of You,,"

The light in this place is really bad
Like being at the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
I'm expecting to wake up from a dream

Means so much, the softest touch
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
I pondered my faith in the rain
I've been dreamin' of you, that's all I do
And it's driving me insane

Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking 'cross the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who they're ringing for

Travel under any star
You'll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
I'm sleeping in the palace of pain
I've been dreamin' of you, that's all I do
But it's driving me insane

Maybe they'll get me, maybe they won't
But whatever it won't be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they never, ever explain
I've been dreamin' of you, that's all I do
And it's driving me insane

Well, I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won't matter, long as you're there

Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreamin' of you is all I do
But it's driving me insane

Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual fall
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in the storm

Maybe you were here and maybe you weren't
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
I'm dreamin' of you, that's all I do
But it's driving me insane

(Evita, Evita, Evita)

It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus:]

No llores por mi Argentina
Mi alma esta contigo
Mi vida entera, te la dedico
Mas no te alejes

Te necesito
Don't cry for me Argentina 
My soul is with you 
My whole life, I dedicate to you 
Don't keep your distance 

I need you 

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[chorus]

[Chorus2:]

No llores por mi Argentina
Jamas yo te he abandonado
Aunque en silencio, mi alma te grita
Hoy y por siempre
(Soy Argentina)
Soy Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina 
I have never left you 
Although in silence, my soul cries to you 
Now and forever 
(I am Argentina)
I am Argentina

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest
The smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic-depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick-ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day, I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places, baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling? Vrumm-vrumm
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
A head and torso of someone; where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly, there's somethin' wrong, 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now, everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on!

These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots

Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone

And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)

I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I like
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock, I don't stop at night.

[Chorus]
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again
I never close my eyes,
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you

I guess I was too off the handle not sentimental enough
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
That I wanted you baby in every kind of way.

Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high
Saying for whose sake did you live for whose sake did you die
Forgive me baby for what I didn't do
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you
Always was a sucker for the right cross
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.

Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell
I'm just as happy as you baby I just can't say it so well
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike
You said you were going to ""Frisco"" stay a couple of months
I always liked San Francisco I was there for a party once
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true
There was no greater love than what I had for you.

Walking out to the dark
Going out a different path lead by a beating heart
All the people of the town gash their eyes to the ground
Of matters to the heart
The night is all you have
You ran into the night from all you had
Found your self a path upon the ground
You ran into the night
You cant be found 
But this is your heart 

Can you feel it 
Can you feel it

Pumps through your veins

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Summer evening breeze is blue
Drawing voices deep from you
Lead by a beating heart

What a year and what a night
What terrifying final sight
Put out your beating heart

The night was all you had you ran into the night from all you had
Found your self a path upon a ground
Ran into the night you cant be found
This is your heart

Can you feel it 
Can you feel it

Pumps through your veins

Can you feel it
Can you feel it

I miss your brain, the way you think
But I don't miss the way you used to drink
I miss our talks, the universal law
You had a way of seeing through my flaws
It's so confusing, I thought I met my match
An intellectual with talent, what a catch
You always said we'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times: I don't miss all of it
You wrote me poetry, you had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Yet I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end
I lost my very best friend
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend
I put away your letters
Saved the best ones that I had
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Yet I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end

It's three in the morning
You're nowhere in sight
And all that I wanted was
To be with you tonight
I've watched love get closer
And then fade away
I've seen you believe in me
I've seen you trying to stay
gut what good is holding on
When you know that all
You can think about is letting go
They say if you love someone
Then set them free
If they come back again
Then in the end it was meant to be
I thought we were lovers
I thought we were friends
I guess when reality steps in
The dreaming ends
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
All you can think about is letting go
Be true to yourself, my love
That's all I ever wanted you to be
Just don't forget to smile
When you think of me
I' II reach for the stars
I have got them in sight
There's someone who really needs me
Out there in the night
We'll live for the future
We'll learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
Why can't they last?

I wanna be wild and young
And not be afraid to lose
Cry on my own
Me and my bottle
These are the things I choose

But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see
That all I wanna do is

Get a little wild
Get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and
Not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me then
Go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong
I'm young

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I wanna fight
And fall off the tables
Then wait to regret last night
My heavy heart pounds deep like a dagger
'Cause I'm not afraid
To bite

But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see
That all I wanna do is

Get a little wild

Kiss a hundred boys and

In France, a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance, his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same

At home there are seventeen year old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called 'The Disciples'
High on crack, toting a machine gun

Time, time...

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is telling you somebody died

A sister killed her baby
'Cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer
For the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

Time, time...

It's silly no, when a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly away?
But some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies, oh, why?
Time...

Baby, make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbours just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody hear the dawn?
Time...

Is it silly no, when a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly away?
Some say that man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies, oh, why?...
Time...

Doubt forever in our hearts
And in a while we'll have to pick up the traces

Yes I really do

Aha um hum

A chance to see the sun,

Now both of us are in a state of confusion
Hesitation on our hearts.
Something unwanted has entered our existence

Another body to grow old

Another place for us to die

Another love that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face

Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away

Ooh how I miss you

Driven deep beneath the waves

The dusky light the day is losing
Orchards, poppies, black eyed Susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
I take you 'cross the river, dear
You no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like

The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs and
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees
The petals blinking white, the wind has blown
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

The trailing moss in mystico, the purple blossom soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me

Old pulses running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that grow
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone

And who keep what is written therein

He is coming with the clouds 
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works, I know your toil, and your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not
And found them to be false
I know that you are enduring patiently and bearing out for my namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned the love you had

[from Revelation 2:9-10]
I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say that they are Jews, but they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping, praying for you to justify my love

[from Revelation 13:1-10]
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power, and his throne, and great authority
One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound that was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder

Men worshipped the dragon for he had given his authority to the beast 
And they worshipped the beast saying
""Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?""
And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous words against God

It was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it in vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

Wanting, needing, waiting for you to justify my love
Hoping

[from Revelation 21:1-8]
Then, I saw a new heaven and a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying:
""Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For these things will have passed away

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators, and all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone.""

[from Revelation 22:10-13]
And he said to me, he said to me:
""Do not seal up the words of the prophecy, for the time is near
Let the evildoers still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy
Behold, I am coming soon
I am the alpha and the omega
The first and the last
The beginning and the end.""

Amen

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind
You see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place

I'm asking him to change his ways
('Cause you better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart

You can't close your your mind
(Then you close your mind!)

That man, that man, that man, that man
With that man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Gonna feel real good now
Oh, no, oh, no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Shame on
Change

Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it yourself
(Yeah! Make that change!)
I've gotta make that change today
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not let yourself, brother
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know
I've got to get that man, that man
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move
Come on! Come on!
You got to stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah. Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself now

Gonna make that change
Come on

"
3025,Bob Dylan,,Yonder Comes Sin,,"

You wanna talk to me,
You got many things to say.
You want the spirit to be speaking through,
But your lust for comfort get in the way.
I can read it in your eyes, oh,
What your heart will not reveal.
And that old evil burden has been draggin' you down,
Bound to grind you 'neath the wheel

Yonder comes sin.
(Walkin' like a man, talkin' like an angel.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Proud like a peacock, swift like an eagle.)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they been into.
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

You see this woman standin' next to me.
She's foreign to your sight.
Well, her eyes may be a different colour than mine,
But her blood is red and her bones are white.
You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things,
But your fifty-dollar smile confirms
You're still tryin' to buy your way into the dreams of them,
Whose bodies will be food for worms.

Yonder comes sin.
(Ready and steady, willing and able.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Standin' on the chair, standin' on the table.)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

I say: See them six wild horses, honey.
You say: I don't even see one..
You say: Point them out to me, love.
I say: Honey I got to run.
My brother's blood is crying from the grave,
But you can't hear the voice.
I stand in jeopardy every hour,
Wonderin' what reason you have to rejoice.

Yonder comes sin.
(Down on your knees, down into the ditches.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Vomiting up jewels, vomiting up riches.)
Look at your feet see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Enough to put you to tail-spin.
Yonder comes sin.

Jeremiah preached repentance
To those that would turn from hell.
But the critics all gave him such bad reviews.
Put him down at the bottom of a well.
Kept on talking anyway,
As the people were put into chains.
Wasn't nobody there to say ""Bon voyage""
Or shatter any bottles of champagne.

Yonder comes sin.
(Cracking that whip, just like a feather.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Put a knife in your back while talking about the weather.)
Look at your feet see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Can you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

Burn your kingdom to the ground

Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends

That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul

I know your favorite song
I hear it everyday
Whoever made your smile
Made it to get in my way
And every time you laugh
You make that little sound
It's just the hardest thing
To love you but not know how

So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you but these things just don't go away

I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better then I would believe
We were made for each other
But I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

What good are words when they always just get in our way
And it hurts the most just to know that you don't feel the same, the same
So sometimes I get down on my knees and I pray things will change
But life is what happens when things they don't work out our way, our way

So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you but these things just don't go away, away

I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better then I would believe
We were made for each other
But I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Sent shivers down my spine

Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Dead inside!

Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share

Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me babe
Do you have no soul
It's like it died long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside!

You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go

You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside!

Feel me now
Hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me
Stop hiding from me
It's hurting babe
Only you can stop the pain

Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything
I can't give you anymore
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotise

You've taught me to lie
Without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside!

Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him

Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls

Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise

Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none

(Arthur Crudup)
Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right.
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

Mama she done told me,
Papa done told me too
'Son, that gal your foolin' with,
She ain't no good for you'
But, that's all right, that's all right.
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging 'round your door
Well, that's all right, that's all right.
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Metal Militia
Metal Militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Metal Militia
Metal Militia

We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Do you think of me when you're in California alone?
It's a lonely place at the best of times, Lord knows
I won't lie to you, I could have given you more
But life got fast, good things don't last anymore

Now and then you cross my mind
It takes me back to a sweeter time
But I let it go
I let you go

Till I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see
You run through my head, in and out of my dreams
Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
But you're not here, baby, and I can't love anyone else
Till I forgive myself

Did you lie to me when you said I was all that you need?
Guess we'll never know all the beautiful things we could be

Now and then you cross my mind
It takes me back to a sweeter time
But I let it go
I let you go

Till I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see
You run through my head, in and out of my dreams
Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
But you're not here, baby, and I can't love anyone else
Till I forgive myself

Till I forgive myself

Till I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see
You run through my head, in and out of my dreams
Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
But you're not here, baby, and I can't love anyone else

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
Ah, before you went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside of me
Why'd you have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore...

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
I said love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here

Daddy was a preacher
Mama had the features of an angel
Born in Oklahoma to an Anglo
Whose Anglo was pimping like a Klango
In the cutlass backseat window
I do this for my kid folk
Who saw Katrina hit and said
""But goddamn it, have we been broke
Scribes for the king
And please send my pleasantries
To the local peasantries
But although we live in hell
We can still dream heavily""
(Don't live here, don't live here anymore)
Scholar's a felon
Ain't no telling, fella!
He told me I wasn't shit
I had to show him better
Poetic like a letter from my mistress
Who after my performance in Paris 12 district
Wrote in broken English in a match book:
'You are terrific
And your style was godly amazing!'
Signed with pink stained lips
And a chocolate she was saving
And that note, I kept, it wept
On the metro station steps
Not giving a fuck about who saw me
For my bravery just applaud me
But love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here

Oh I'll see you in the future
When we're old and when we're full of stories to be told
Cross my heart and hope to die
See you with your laughter lines
I'll see you there

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
And if you break my heart
Then blood's gonna spill here

I'll see you in the future when we're older
And we are full of stories to be told
Cross my heart and hope to die
I'll see you with your laughter lines

I know it's hard to reach you
I know it's hard to breathe
I know it's hard to be you sometimes
I can't imagine what that means

This must be someone else's story
I can't follow what you've planned
How can this be about me
Am I supposed to understand

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me

You're still looking for redemption
Still can't find a trace
If there is nothing after
There'll be no saving grace

I'm giving you control now
I need some kind of sign
Come take away this sorrow now
I gave you all that's mine

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me

When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
And I know, each time I kiss you
That your heart's on fire too

So, my darling, please surrender
All your love so warm and tender
Let me hold you in my arms, dear
While the moon shines bright above

All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love

Won't you please surrender to me
Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear
Be mine forever
Be mine tonight

I'm so hurt to think that you lied to me
I'm hurt way down deep inside of me
You said our love was true and we'll never, never part
Now you've got someone new and it breaks my heart

I'm hurt, much more than you'll ever know
Yes darling, I'm so hurt because I still love you so
But even though you hurt me like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you, oh you, no you

Gotta do some livin', got the wanderlust
Better clear the highway 'cause I'm gonna move some dust

2436,Barbra Streisand,2005.0,Letting Go,"""Guilty Pleasures""","

A child that hides behind a chair
Almost afraid to grow
Without you there
Whisper words that make you see
What you've come to mean to me

A voice that rises from the heart
The hunger seizes me
And tears my soul apart
And serving only to renew
How I came to feel for you

Through your love I'd see forever
We became as one
I never saw you turn away
My love was blind
You call me when your storm is over
Crying over love that I can give you
When the night is colder
Holding on to me

'Cause it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
With your face that lies
You memorize the reason why

And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go

Foolish that I still believe
That love should never die
It makes me cry to witness where the story ends
All the lovers in the world
Will echo all the words
That I will leave you
When the night is lonely
Only goes to show

That it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
And I kneel and pray for yesterday
When you were mine

And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go.

Yeah
Shady (Ha-ha)
50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Ha-ha)
Here we go again
Yeah
The evil genius, Green Lantern

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, ""What up?"", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, ""Ja, what up, dawg?""
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Tony!

You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
Lloyd Banks!

Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out your van and (Break it, break it, break it down!)
They see me pop a boy icy 'cause I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (Hood)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us if half of your artists got make-up on?
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is, sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, motherfucker

I know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You know you don't want it with me
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)

You don't wanna bump heads with me (Wanna bump heads with me)

Yeah, nigga
Yeah, Shady Aftermath

Fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?

Honey, honey, can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
Oh, won't you please let me
Because they get to me
They touch me and then move me
I get to thinking I won't be needin'
Anything more to keep me warm
I feel the feeling of you
Al1 the way through
No other feeling will ever do
Honey, honey,
Can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
They're just like old friends
When we're together
They comfort me and soothe me
They're not brand new
They're a little worn through,
But they're comfy and roomy
They do something to me
And when I stay at home
And you're far away
I won' t be lonely all through the day
Honey, honey,
Can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
I feel the feeling of you
All the day through
No other feeling will ever do
Honey, honey,

Because they feel so good
And they feel like you...

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures

See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell.
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me,

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice

Long-nighter, short height, and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

'Cause people think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow

From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces

I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache

I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos

I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me,

Still got a rucksack for the old clothes,
I rap with the cold flows,
I'm back with the old jokes,
In fact you don't know,
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate,

Man, flows developing,
Skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
I do it for the hell of it,
'Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team,
I seem to sell a bit,

I took what held me back with the women,
And then I packaged the image,
Put in some content,
And then I sold it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this,
I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses,
I think I need to practice this,

But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders,
I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rapping back to back
'Cause I've been practicing,
I'm back to sing this

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

Breaks free of my wooden neck
Left a nod over sleeping waves
Like bobbing bait for bathing cod
Floating flocks of candled swans
Slowly drift across wax ponds

The men all played along
To marching drums
And boy did they have fun
Behind the sea
They sang
So our matching legs
Are marching clocks
And we're all too small
To talk to God
Yes, we're all too smart
To talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch
Sprouting sons and ageless daughters

Those watermelon smiles
Just can't ripen underwater
Just can't ripen underwater

When I needed understanding were you really there?
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, 'cause I don't see either one of us budging

""I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect""
That's what he says to himself
As he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
'Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally

Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card
And it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be taking too much E

Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we're so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
And I'm not excluding myself
'Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

You ain't no motherfucking bully
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

Get at me, dog

Wet is rain
Rain is clean and new
New is the morning
And morning dew
Wet is a kiss that touches you
Wet is sea
Sea is mysterious blue
Blue is for sadness
And sad is for crying
Tears are wet too
Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain
Drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade
Sometimes
I'm not afraid of melt in the rain
I'm not afraid to be lost at see
I'm not afraid to cry again
Because it's tears of joy
You bring to me
Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain
Drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade
Sometimes
Wet is love
Love that's flowing free
Free is the feeling I feel deep inside me
Come and see that wet is me...

How come I was the last to know?
Took the stage then you stole the show
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon
I was captured by that stare
Now I'm shattered but I don't care
And the people walking by don't have a clue

That I kissed your face
Till the sun was in our eyes
Till the afternoon arrived
And I can't explain
Last night I saw the fireworks
The kind of pain that never hurts
The one you hate to love is made for you
Another unsuspecting Sunday afternoon

Monday is a funny thing
Still waiting for the phone to ring
Will my imagination take it slow?
Oh-yeah, after Saturday, my life is changed
In a moment it was rearranged
Strange how easy it is letting go

And I miss your face
Like the sun was in my eyes
And now I am running blind
And I can't explain

Love has gone, what can matter?
No sweet lover man comes to call.
When sunny gets blue
She breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violins are playing
Weird and haunting melodies
People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got a name
Since that sad affair
She lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same
Memories will fade
And pretty dreams will rise
Up where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry dear
To kiss away each lonely tear
And hold me near

I don't wanna say goodbye

A poor mans heart break

Baby you turn me on
But as quick as a flash your love is gone
Baby I'm gonna leave you now

Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation so

Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord

Life here is grand with friends I love so dear
Comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face that chilling hand of death
Won't you tell me

Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end

When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him Jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home

I'm lost in empty pillow talk again

This room's become a mausoleum, filled with relics of regret
Paying dues to every moment wasted, on words left unsaid
Collisions of a finer love, I'd kill for one more way
To tell you how you make me better every day

If these sheets were the states, and you were miles away,
I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me.
Because I don't sleep at all without you pressed up against me.
I settle for long distance calls, I'm lost in empty pillow talk again.

I wake up in the morning
Put on my face
The one that's gonna get me
Through another day
Doesn't really matter
How I feel inside
This life is like a game sometimes

But then you came around me
The walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me
And keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust

'Cause I've never felt like this before
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you

Why I was afraid
To be myself and let the
The covers fall away
Guess I never had someone like you
To help me, to help me fit
In my skin

I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound
And rode into Raleigh
And on across Caroline

We had motor trouble that turn into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
And that hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away I brought me a through train ticket
Ridin' across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just to help me get to Houston Town
There are people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down

Sure as you're born brought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Alberquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the golden state
Ah when the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate

Swing low chariot come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone

Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten o nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy is on the line

Come on, just snap, snap, snap your fingers for me
Good, good, now we're making some progress
Come on, just tap, tap, tap your toes to the beat
And I believe this may call for a proper introduction, and well

This is the scent of quarantine wings in a hospital

It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal
The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering where
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
No it's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
And it sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

Sit back, sit back, relax, relapse
Sit back, sit back, woah

To be forgetting you in a cabaret somewhere
Downtown where a burlesque queen
May even ask my name
As she sheds her skin on stage
I'm seated and sweating to a dance song
On the club's P.A
The strip joint veteran sits two away
Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
Peach and lime daiquiri

And isn't this exactly where you'd like me?
I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know
Praying for love in a lap dance
And paying in naivety?
Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me?

Praying for love in a lap dance, oh

But, but I'm afraid that I
Well, I may have faked it
And I wouldn't be caught dead

Come here my serenade, my desert serenade

Wherever lovers dwell, it weaves it's magic spell
Soon a thousand dreams will start,
And romance will fill your heart

Cowgirl, cowgirl why did you leave me high and dry?
You had a heart but then you put a hole in mine

Listen - I wanna break down
You don't understand the damage you've done now
Let me remind you that
I had a heart and you came inside
Turned the whole place upside down

Now I'm out of my mind
Rocking chair, mental asylum
Everyone dressed in white
I really think I've lost it this time

Yeah, I wanna break down
You don't understand the damage you've done now
Let me remind you that boys don't cry
Isn't it clear that I need treatment?

All day, all night see I could go from dusk til dawn (whoah)
Thinking about how you left me crushed and torn (whoah)

I wanna break down (come on)
You don't understand the damage you've done now (come on)
Let me remind you that (uh huh)
I had a heart and you came inside
Turned the whole place upside down

Yeah, yeah, I wanna break down (uh huh)
You don't understand the damage you've done now (uh huh)
Let me remind you that boys don't cry
Isn't it clear that I need treatment?

Cause I'm insane in the membrane, so crazy, you make me, yeah
Insane in the membrane, look what you've created

Look what you did
Look what you did
My baby, oh, no, no

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my love on over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks are dancing, there are all shook up

And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Time has come again
And love is in the wind
Like some music in a dream
You made them all come true
When you came inside my life
Now I'm lost inside of you
Lost in the music and lost in your eyes

Hearing songs you sing
Hearing songs you sing
Feeling love you bring to me
Darling being close to you
Made all, made all my dreams come true
When you came inside my life
Now I'm lost inside of you

[Akon:]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

[Biggie:]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
( you betta have your gat in hand cause man )

[Akon:]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

[2pac:]
Our lifestyles be close captioned
addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

[Akon:]
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)

Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)

[Biggie:]
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

My niggas on the corner still selling cocaine
Now I ain't even tripping you should do the same thing

No longer sitting in the coupe handing out birds
Collecting all this money from different parts of the world
Flown up out of this loop, gotta see me first

You ain't got enough what it takes to beat me
Conditioned by the slums and raised by the streets
I've killed for this life it takes another soldier

And now, I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
But then, it seems that I had seen it in her eyes
Though it might not be wise, I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside, I can't deny
I just can't let it die, 'cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
So, if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light still shining bright
And even on the darkest night, she can't deny

So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

No matter how I try, you say it's all a lie
So what's the use of my confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die, in my heart?

So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

So, now I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I had seen it in her eyes
And now, it seems that I gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye

Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out
Ringing in my ears

Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
'Cause ev'ry time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight

Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry

Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

I used to think that we'd run away
One lovely, pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be OK, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

I used to think that we'd reunite
I'd be your wife, in the real life
I thought that you'd come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Is this the only way?

Those left-over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day!

And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way!

Where is that worn-out wish
That I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?

A cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here!

The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

Not to be annoying, not to be annoying
But I wanna keep it going
It's like a epic poem except the letters growing
Punctuate it with the moaning, it's so real

You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy

The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out

I hear the door-bell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me...

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling...

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door
I feel I'm 
Crackin' up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Crackin' up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror evergrowing
Crackin' up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Crackin' up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me...

Will it get me far? 
Should I lose some weight? 
Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy, 
I tried to be a girl 
I tried to be a mess, 
I tried to be the best 
I guess I did it wrong, 
That's why I wrote this song 

This type of modern life - Is it for me? 
This type of modern life - Is it for free?
So, I went into a bar looking for sympathy 
A little company - I tried to find a friend 
It's more easily said it's always been the same 
This type of modern life -Is not for me? 
This type of modern life -Is not for free? 

American life 
I live the American dream 
You are the best thing I've seen, 
You are not just a dream

I tried to stay ahead,
I tried to stay on top 
I tried to play the part,
But somehow I forgot 
Just what I did it for 
And why I wanted more 
This type of modern life - Is it for me? 
This type of modern life - Is it for free?

Do I have to change my name? 
Will it get me far? 
Should I lose some weight? 
Am I gonna be a star?

I get a double shot 
It goes right through my body 
And you know 
I'm satisfied,
I drive my mini cooper 
And I'm feeling super-dooper 
Yo they tell I'm a trooper 
And you know I'm satisfied 
I do yoga and pilates 
And the room is full of hotties 
So I'm checking out the bodies 
And you know I'm satisfied 
I'm digging on the isotopes 
This metaphysic's shit is dope 
And if all this can give me hope 
You know I'm satisfied 
I got a lawyer and a manager 
An agent and a chef 
Three nannies, an assistant 
And a driver and a jet 
A trainer and a butler 
And a bodyguard or five 
A gardener and a stylist 
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view 
I'm not Christian and I'm not a Jew 
I'm just living out the American dream 
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems 

Do I have to change my name 
Am I gonna be a star 
Do I have to change my name 
Am I gonna be a star? 
Do I have to change my name

Hey... Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know...
Hmm...

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one...

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out? '
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us.
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing.
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never wanna be alo-oh-oh-one...

I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...

It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...
It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was rapeing his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face

There's no freedom or self respect
A knife's point or a trip to the joint
Is about all you can expect

They kill people here who stand up for their rights
The system's just too damned corrupt
It's always the same, the name of the game
Is who do you know higher up

Wealth is a filthy rag

So wrapped up in the American flag

Turns children into crooks and slaves
Whose heroes and healers are real stoned dealers
Who should be put in their graves

This might be your last night in a bed so soft
There are pimps on the make, politicians on the take

And watch it burn without any regret
We got the power, we're the new government
You just don't know it yet

And my uncles from World War II

One day though you'll be talking in your sleep
And when you do, I wanna be there

(Ain't nobody else but you)
There's no one like you

There is nobody who can make it right
Nobody else can do it
Nobody but you, you know what to do
(Ain't nobody else but you)

Nobody, (nobody) nobody but you

Somebody tell me
'Cause I can't eat or sleep
When you're not close to my body
Your a bittersweet delight
Come and help me through the night (nobody!)

Ain't nobody else can make me cry
Ain't nobody else can make me lie
Nobody but you
(Ain't nobody else but you)
Nobody but you
(No one can make me lie)

Give me one more chance to make it right
Time has come for us to reunite
'Cause baby it's true
(Ain't nobody else but you)
There's no one like you

Cold hands, red eyes
Packed your bags at midnight
They've been there, for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls, don't talk
And if they could they'd say
Can't hide, your secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I know right now, you feel alone
And all the good things, they hurt the most
But it's a long way done, yeah it's a long way down

I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired

I try and feel the sunshine, you bring the rain
You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain, you whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say and you know
I've been the beggar, I've played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

Your stupid girlfriends tell you, that I'm to blame
Well, they're all used up has-beens out of the game
This time I'll have the last word, you hear what I say?
I tried to see it your way, it won't work today

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say, you know
I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

Bullshit and contemplation, gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth, what would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern, it's time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight

You don't get back 14 years in just one day
So hard to keep my own head, just go away, you know
Just like a hooker, she said, ""Nothin's for free""
Oh, I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered ""Goodbye"", she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again,
But I know...

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said ""Goodbye"" too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me

1817,The Beatles,1994.0,Johnny B. Goode,"compilation: ""Live At The BBC. Disk 1""","

Deep down in Louisianna
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

This is what you do, this is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with

Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with

Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)

I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Oh yeah)

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Say what you do)

Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Yeah-hey)

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong

4741,Eminem,,Bad Guys Always Die,,"

The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha, ride

All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die

He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, ""Take ten paces,"" shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a ""G Thang""
And a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'""
I said, ""It's Dre's day,"" and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun

Ugh, fast money, I don't slow dance
Young Money, motherfucker, 'til the world end
Money overweight, bitch—Roseanne
I don't listen to these kids—grown man
Skinny nigga, dope though, ugh, Lohan

Make your soul spin when the ping loading
Au revoir, goodbye, now applaud

Yeah, now it's child's play, nigga
My lil' G, Lil' Chuckee

Young Money lil' G, battle juice in my blood
Jumpin' at the boy, man, you better have your bungee cord

Now, come drag your dog out the ring, how you love that?
Young with an attitude, watch how you talk to me
Keep playin' Freddy, boy, I'll leak on your Elm Street

Lil' Twist Hefner, what it do?

[Lil Twist:]
Ugh! Young Money, good night
And yeah, I'm gon' shine like a ultraviolet light
Lil' Twist gonna sell out like it's opening tonight
Going for the fist nigga to write
You need a telescope sight to try to see me, I'm so far gone
Even though I'm going off, kids, I'm so far on
I got a house full of chicks like the Playboy home
Wrappin' up my lifestyle and I smashed this song, Twizzy

[T-Streets:]
Yeah, next up, we got the best rapstress alive, Nicki Minaj

[Nicki Minaj:]
I'm in that cotton-pickin' Bent, put massa on the guts
White on white whips, Kunta Kinte on the clutch
You at the bottom of the pole—totem
Like Lamar Odom, I ball—scrotum
Flyer than a cricket so they call me ""Nicki Jiminy""
And it's going down like Santa in the chim-i-ney
You don't ball, break your baby-back ribs
You need more assist than the handicapped kids
Oh, shit

[T-Streets:]
And now, the beautiful Miss Shanell

[Shanell:]
Young Money, we're rockstars
So fuck with your Magnum on
And hold on, we go long
You feel that, we get that
We in that, we run that
We bust back
We hit them and we see them comin' back for more
Back for more

[T-Streets:]
Next up, my nigga Mack Maine
Stupid Mack-nupid, one hundred

[Mack Maine:]
Microwave family in the building, you can't hold us
Me, Tez, and Wayne, we the three new moguls
Buffet around here, y'all boys scrape the plates
And we don't eat up in our whips, but they got paper plates
Soon as we leave the club, damn, where the models go
One word I forgot to say on his album: ""Hollygrove!""
This track is the finale, nah, this the genesis
Young Money murderers, we killin' shit, forever

[T-Streets:]
Toronto
Drizzy
Get 'em

[Drake:]
Alright, I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nothing, you would think I'm playin' Tetris
Thousand-dollar sweater on, but I don't never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin' death wish
Yeah, tell me, who controls kings?
I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flyin' through the city in a coupe with those wings
And my team deserves some motherfuckin' Super Bowl rings
Young Money

Wee-zy! Wee-zy! Wee-zy! Wee-zy!

I'm so in this bitch, CEO in this bitch
Lil Weezy stand tall, tippy-toe in this bitch
Blood Gang, motherfucker, da-da-doe in this bitch
Make your girl get Barry Mani-low in this bitch
In the body of the world, money is the blood
And every day, I be back and forward to the blood bank
Ugh, makin' deposits 'til I fucking faint
New Orleans, nigga: How 'bout them fucking Saints?
It's tight on our end, call that ""Bubba Franks""
Matter-fact, it's too tight—add a couple links
I'm the bar's tender, you a woman drink
Yeah, it's Young Money, but the money ain't
Gudda tough, 'Nelly nice, Nick' nasty
Streets bad, Tyga ill, Drake magic
Millz Harlem, Chuck wild, Twist Dallas
And Mack Maine rap, sing and manage, ugh!

Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
You're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been so in love?

Have you ever walked on air?
Ever felt like you were dreaming?
When you never thought it could,
But it really feels that good.
Have you ever been so in love?

You could touch the moonlight.

You're holding heaven in your arms.

Waiting for something
That was heaven-sent.
When you find it, don't let go.
I know.

Have you ever said a prayer
And found that it was answered?
All my hope has been restored,
And I ain't looking anymore.
Have you ever been so in love?
Have you?

Some place that you ain't leaving,
Somewhere you're gonna stay,
When you finally found the meaning.
Have you ever felt this way?

The time I spent
Waiting for something
That was heaven-sent.
When you find it, don't let go.
I know.

'Cause have you ever been in love?

3589,Ed Sheeran,,Eraser (Extended F64 Version),,"

I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind

So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become

Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture-perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well

And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans

Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner

I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue,
And wish that I had known what to do as a younging
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh

And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, ""Fuck you""

I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for

And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Well, yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressin' 'cause
Every day this shit gets the best of us

Usin' my balance on eraser blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold
Mum sayin', ""Don't smoke,"" no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign

Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men

And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit

I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Sat back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish

I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '96, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
Deal with life
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
The segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chip shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""Fuck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare

Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow lil' boy, you gon' learn

When you're just out walking and you pass
Little signs that say ""keep off the grass""
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why?
Pretty playgrounds children used to know
Little squares where lovers love to go
Disappear so parking lots can grow
Why?
Once you start the questions never cease
What's disturbed when you disturb the peace
Pets and children are prohibited
Why? Ask yourself why?
And when you think about it
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen
Recommended wholesome nice and clean
Making love's the thing that can't be seen
Why?
Let your hair down just an inch or two
Let your skin be red or green or blue
They invent a special name for you
Why?
On a clear day oh say can you see
What remains of mountain's scenery
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery... sky......
Beautiful sky ..as shiny as a penny
So when you're out walking and you pass
Near a sign that say ""keep off the grass""
Put a sign right next to it that says ""why?""

Why can't you be like the other girls?""
I said: ""Oh no, that's not me and I don't think that it'll ever be.""

Thought I belong to a different tribe
Walking alone never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in but it wasn't me,
I said: ""Oh no, I want more. That's not what I'm looking for.""

So I took the road less travelled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love - I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the other say: ""Look at you, look at you
Trying to be so provocative.""
I said: ""Oh yeah, that was me.
All the things I did just to be seen.""

Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said: ""Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be.""

I said: ""Hell yeah! This is me
Right where I'm supposed to be""

So I took the road less travelled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love - I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart

So I took the road less travelled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love - I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart

In my rebel heart
In my rebel heart

Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22?
'Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches what you know 'bout me, nigga

What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know 'bout me
What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know

The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'

They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's 'cause I get, I get, I get busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me (no)
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Look, all the kids sweat Nic like a Mexican (mira, mira)
'Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan—
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
'Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know 'bout me
What you know' bout me, what you, what you know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'

Then maybe she's put you in a blind
She'll give you just a little lovin'

Throw you in a choke—gun smoke, gun smoke

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep

Keeps us from falling apart
No matter where I go I hear

No one can move me

Nothing erases this feeling between me and you

I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright

Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

Ooh…

Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games

You don't cry, you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

Ooh, oh

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down. I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded dark hallways
Mmm

I try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

Yeah
So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mill when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave ""BAD"" back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated, the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by

Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you
Not out of spite or anger
But simply because it's true
Now, I hope you won't object to this
Giving back all what you owe
The fewer words you have to waste on this
The sooner you can go.

Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

Nothing was delivered
But I can't say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be
Yes, for telling all those lies
Now you must provide some answers
For what you sold has not been received
And the sooner you come up with them
The sooner you can leave.

Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

Now you know
Nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made ev'rybody pay
No, nothing was delivered
Yes, 'n' someone must explain
That as long as it takes to do this
Then that's how long that you'll remain
Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

A fella who never blushes in
And that is that ev'ryone
Must always flush out his house
If he don't expect to be
Goin' 'round housing flushes
Open the door, Homer
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Homer
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

""Take care of all your memories""
Said my friend, Mick
""For you can not relive them
And remember when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them""
Open the door, Homer
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Homer
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you

I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you
But she's looking at you

Seasons came and changed the time
He grew up and I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
""Remember when we used to play?""

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Blew me to pieces I've never been
And now you're lying on the cold, hard ground 

Baby, this is what you came for 
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her 
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.

I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
And I'd still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was dark as night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.

Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure won't lead you astray
Won't hold you back, won't mess up your day
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious

You don't want a love that's pure

You put your arms around me
Partners in crime in the dead of night
It's our weekend religion
A different chord but the same refrain

We've only got ourselves to blame
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Let every night play out the same
'Cause I wouldn't, I wouldn't change a thing

We're nocturnal creatures, we own the night
And we don't need a reason if we want to lose our minds
We're nocturnal creatures, drawn to the flame
And the morning doesn't reach us
Well, not until we want it to, want it to

We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're noc-, we're noc-, we're nocturnal

No moon, no stars above us
The orange sky says the night's alive
This time with you's elastic
We stretch these hours as far as we can make them go

We've only got ourselves to blame
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Let every night play out the same
'Cause I wouldn't, I wouldn't change a thing

We're nocturnal creatures, we own the night
And we don't need a reason if we want to lose our minds
We're nocturnal creatures, drawn to the flame
And the morning doesn't reach us
Well, not until we want it to, want it to

Oh-oh-oh-oh...

We're nocturnal creatures, we own the night
And we don't need a reason if we want to lose our minds
We're nocturnal creatures, drawn to the flame
And the morning doesn't reach us
Well, not until we want it to, want it to

Oh, oh
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal

It felt like the hungry people received the foods and we just ate everything

2644,Bob Dylan,1970.0,Blue Moon,"""Self Portrait""","

Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for.

And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own.

Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me

Jab it
Here come the pins

Blood for face
Sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse
A ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun
Pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith
Which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?

Tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine
And I'm pain free

Jab another pin in me

No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me

Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.

Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave.

I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster, too
If there's a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door

Love comes from the most unexpected places
In someone's eyes you've never met
Who wants to get to know you
In someone's smile you can't forget
And if the music plays on in your mind
Take all the love that you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love that you can find
And hope it comes again
Love comes from the most unexpected places
A love song on the radio you never heard enough of
In bars that thrive on loneliness
Where people sell their sorrow for your time
They take the love that they can find
And if love takes them in
They take the love that they can find
And hope it comes again

Love comes in many ways
In lovers' arms in sweet bouquets
But if nothing's said than nothing's ever heard
So here I stand outside your door
And I'm trying to tell you just once more
That I love you
I still love you

Love comes from the most unexpected places
Alone again I search a street of unrelated faces
Where strangers look the other way
They're so afraid my smile might say ""come in""
And take the love that you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love that you can find
And hope love comes again

Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love

Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen

[Che:]
Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behavior
But how long do you think this pantomime can last?
Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There's one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you're our savior
When those who oppose you are stepped on,
Or cut up, or simply disappear?

[Eva:]
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say,
Alter the time-honored way the game is played?
Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don't care what the bourgeoisie say
I'm not in business for them
But to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two

[Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental

[Eva:]
So what are my chances of honest advances?
I'd say low
Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo

[Che:]
Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self-esteem
How can you be so short-sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?

[Eva:]
Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
And mark your adieu with three cheers
But first tell me who'd be delighted
If I said I'd take on the world's greatest problems
From war to pollution, no hope of solution
Even if I lived for one hundred years

[Che and Eva:]
There is evil, ever around
Fundamental system of government
Quite incidental

[Eva:]
So go, if you're able, to somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate in some tottering state
But not here, dear
Is that clear, dear?

Oh what I'd give for a hundred years
But the physical interferes
Every day more, O my Creator
What is the good of the strongest heart
In a body that's falling apart?
A serious flaw, I hope You know that

She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered ""No"" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much to soon

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered ""No"" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
Day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Oh, oh
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

7496,Usher,,Call Me A Mack,,"

Yo!
What's sup?
Hey!
My name is Usher
You can trust there ain't
No punks in this house
And if you really wanna know what my name is!
Just call me a mack
Word
Right!
Just call me the mack
Anytime baby
'Cause I ain't confused!

I may be kinda young
But I got a whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't complain (Huh, ha!)
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib
And chill
But just be sure
That you call me first
Because the last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)
Learned how to play a player
And do you know why
Because the mack

Just call me a mack
'Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well-known fact
That I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Just call me a mack!

Now, baby I ain't dumb
And all those silly
Games that you play
I see right through
So let me kick it to you (To you!)
I don't have a lot of girls
But I gotta know
I'll get the respect that I give
That's just the way I live
Because the last girl
I had was moving
Things too fast (Slow down)
She tried to pull a fooler
And do you know
What had happened

Just call me a mack
'Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you

The mack is right here
And yes I care as much
Just giving a little love
It's spreading everywhere
You see it's
Here
Here
And here
Catch a feeling
I'm having a little trouble
I know my girl will always
Hit it
Pit it
Like an orange
'Cause it looks
Like numbness
My lovin' and
Hugin'
And bitterness
My peeps keep
Pumpin'
Humpin'
On stage
I'm engaged
And yes
The truth is it
You see an
Ugly woman
You better change

Oh, yes
Like Usher's my name
I can't go changing
My ways (Oh, no)
As long as I'm chillin'
Then baby
You can call me the mack

Just call me a mack
'Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well-known fact
That I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Just call me a mack!

2603,Bob Dylan,1967.0,The Ballad Of Frankie Lee And Judas Priest,"""John Wesley Harding""","

Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed more money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain"".

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
""Would ya please not stare at me like that"", he said
""It's just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide"".

Well, Judas he just winked and said
""All right, I'll leave you here
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear""
""I'm gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you''ll be"".

Judas pointed down the road
And said, ""Eternity""
""Eternity ?"" said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
""That's right"", said Judas Priest, ""Eternity
Though you might call it Paradise""
""I don't call it anything""
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
""All right"", said Judas Priest
""I'll see you after a while"".

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feelin' low and mean
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father is deceased ?
Well, if you are
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest"".
""Oh yes, he is my friend""
Said Frankie Lee in fright
""I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight""
Yes, that's the one"", said the stranger
As quit as a mouse.
""Well, my message is, he's down the road
Stranded in a house"".

Well, Frankie Lee he panicked
He dropped ev'rythimg and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
""What kind of a house is this"", he said
""Where I have come to roam ?""
""It's not a house"", said Judas Priest
""It's not a house, it's a home"".

Well, Frankie Lee he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over ev'rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there starring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in ev'ry one.

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful bounding leap
And foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst.

No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest
Except of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along alone
Whit his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
""Nothing is revealed"".
Well, the moral of the story
The moral of the song
Is simply that one should never be
Where ones does not belong
So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'
Help him with his load
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road.

Summer days and summer nights are gone

I've got a house on the hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I've got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
I've got a long haired woman, she got royal Indian blood

Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready, lift up your glasses and sing
Well I'm standin' on the table, I'm proposin' a toast to the king

I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say ""You're a worn out star""
My pockets are loaded, and I'm spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else,
you know it's me all the time

Well the fog's so thick you can't spy the land
Well the fog's so thick that you can't even spy the land
what good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman

Weddin' bells are ringin' and the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the weddin' bells are ringin' and the choir's beginning to sing
What looks good in the day, at night is another thing

She's looking in to my eyes, and she's a-holding my hand
She looks in to my eyes, she's holding my hand
she say, ""you can't repeat the past,""
I say ""You can't? What do you mean you can't?
Of course you can.""

Where do you come from, where do you go?
Sorry, that is nothing you would need to know
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seems like it's stuck
Why don't you break my heart one more time, just for good luck

I got eight carburators and boys I'm usin' 'em all
well, I got eight carburators and boys I'm usin' 'em all
I'm short on gas, my motor's startin' to stall

My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
I got my hammer ringin' pretty baby, but the nails ain't goin' down

If you got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, if you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police

Politician's got on his joggin' shoes
he must be runnin' for office, got no time to lose
suckin' the blood out of the genius of generosity
you been rollin' your eyes, you been teasin' me

Standin' by God's river my soul's beginning to shake
Standin' by God's river my soul's beginning to shake
I'm countin' on you, love, to gimme a break

I'm leaving in the morning, as soon as the dark clouds lift
I'm leaving in the morning, as soon as the dark clouds lift
I'm breakin' the roof, set fire to the place as a partin' gift

Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days, summer nights are gone
I know a place where there's still something goin' on.

And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard"", the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack [*click*]

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)

I like the way you lick the bowl
Somehow your method touches my soul
It lifts me up to heights unknown
So when they ask, ""How's life?"" I go (sheesh, sheesh)

When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)

Your mama sent us horoscopes (horoscopes)
Had so much fun watching them unfold (watch them unfold)
You said she like me, I smiled, I know
So when they ask, ""How's life?"" I go (sheesh, sheesh)

When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt

Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh, oh
Talking about what you wanna do, whatever's wrong or right
I am followin' you 'cause you make me say oh, oh
Say, I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, it'd be so sour
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

When life deals us cards

You don’t actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You’re not really there
Hallucination

I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination

I understand you think you’re above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair

They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination

Oh you think you’re so special
That there’s no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We’re mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below

Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with

Poor pitiful creature

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy

An idiot’s idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we’re a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you’re able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature

To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshippers

We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body

The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don’t even see us
You were never caring

You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You’re way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying

I’m clawing your chest
‘Til your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples ’til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox

I’m doomed, I’m swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?

The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?

You’re way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You’re way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy

My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying

You’re way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner,
It’s true
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot’s idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin’ sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We’re meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants

Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you’re so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are

The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot’s idiocy
My caring for you
You think I’m a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin’ feet on
When you’re able

The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders

We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty

Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won’t you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he’s driving towards
An island of lost souls

Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or – oh, state of grace

Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery

The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad

Rose-tinted view
And satellites that
Compromise the truth

But I wanted more
With the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face
A hopeless embrace

Faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love

It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
Believes we could be glorious

I need to believe
But I still want more
With the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door
On what you adore

And faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love

It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
Believes we could be glorious

And you still let me win

And who was I to say
That this was meant to be?
The road that was broken
Brought us together

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I was upside down
From the outside in
You came to the table
And you went all in

With a single word
And a gentle touch
You turned a moment
Into forever

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me

Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic!

Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection

The lovers
The lovers
The dreamers
The dreamers
And me

Burning fires in this room

Light and smooth

Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep

Better catch it
Before it burns this place down

Those new tricks
Warm me up
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down

Lips to cheek

You were the shadow to my light, did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight, wanna see us
Alight

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, a-aaah

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes

Once he took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes

I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone

It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

It keeps right on a'hurtin every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

1558,Bastille,,Drop It Like It's Royal Mashup,,"

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Crystal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
This kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B

Let me live that fantasy
Snoop...
Let me live this fantasy
I wanna live this fantasy
Snoop...

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Cause
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying ""Lord I just don't care""
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

I got the eye of the tiger
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

It don't run in our blood
This kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule

Let me live this fantasy
I wanna live this fantasy
I wanna live this fantasy

Let me live, let me live, let me live, let me live

So I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking that maybe it might lead me home

I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years that faith lives on, somehow

There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way

But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived

And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

I still have faith in you
It stands above the crazy things we did
It all comes down to love

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived

And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

And we still have it in us
We've only just arrived

Humble and grateful
To have survived

It all comes down to love
Do I have it in me?

Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheating liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

It's your girl Nicki Minaj, bitches
Listen, y'all better buckle y'all motherfuckin' seat-belts broads
It's goin' down

Fitted down and I'm ready to play
When ya album gonna drop, bitches never could say
Say, ""Fuck I look like giving birds they props?
Bitches act like they hot, but I heard they not""
How the fuck you in the game like ten years strong
You bitches still can't write ya own damn songs
You see me on the stoop man these birds just salute me
Whether I'm in the coupe or the hoopti, Duke see
I'm always with a dude, that'll off the kufi
Let him eat my coochie and cop me Pucci
House in the boonies, rock a doobie
Cock the 22, then spark a loosey
He tell me I'm the one, he probably right
He pressing me like button downs on a Friday night
Your girl get it poppin' like dynamite
Dynamite, the coke albino white
Name one bitch in the game, that I can't murder
Chicken noodle bitches, on the side with a soda
Give it to everybody, like a cop with a quota
Stop playing poker hop in something mocha
I eat bitches, no knife, no fork-a (or)
Bitch want it with me? Living the life lo-ca
Oh, I get it you a joker
Leave a dot on your head, and I ain't talking 'bout polka
You the type, that be runnin' ya mouth
See you on the block, wanna run in ya house
I'm with that nigga Fendi, never fucks with a slouch
I fuck with dirty money, like what's under the couch
'Cause ain't a bitch could fuck with my flow
When it comes to drugs, mami just say no
Either you're on something or you're S-L-O
Had to switch up the flow, let this skeptos (sketels) know
I come, cum hard, I don't come with garbage
Just one phone call, they gon' come regardless
I always got the ball ma, I don't roll with starters
Write my own bars and my flow's the hardest, nigga

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats

He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me

But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Know about me, know, know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, he don't wanna know

Gotta move, gotta get out
Gotta leave this place, gotta find some place
Some other place, some brand new place
Some place where each face that I see
Won't be staring back at me
Telling me what to be and how to be it
Some place where I can just be me
Gotta move, got to get out
Gotta leave this town, gotta find some town
Some big new town, some bright new town
Some new town with new places, new lights
And most of all some new faces
Gotta find a man, a new man
A man who won't worry 'bout where I go
A man who wont ask how I learned what I know
A man who will know that I've gotta be free
A man who will know when to just let me be
Gotta move, gotta get out
Gotta change my life, gotta find my life
I'll find me a place in some new town and baby
And when I find me that new place, then maybe I
Gotta leave this town, gotta leave this place
Gotta find a new man...Gotta move!

On Saturday I know that you’re coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you’ll never know it was easy
It won’t help pretending that we’ll stay close
I can’t help thinking that
I try to pretend that it’s your loss
And I never know, oh I’ll never know if it will work

There’s no better time
She’s still thinking I’m too far away
Understanding why she’s not thinking I’m a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today

Come Sunday I’ll see that one day you’ll rescue me 
And when I leave again I’ll feel strange
And I’ll never know, oh I’ll never know if you’re in love again
I can’t stop being a fool for you
I won’t help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I’ll never know, oh I’ll never know if I’m in love

There’s no better time
She’s still thinking I’m too far away
Understanding why she’s not thinking I’m a fool to wait
But I left her today

I'm just a tenant, paying rent inside this body and I
Got two windows and those windows, well I'll call them my eyes
I'm just going where the wind blows, I don't get to decide

Sometimes I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed

Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building
I ran to the hills till they found me
And they put me back in my cell
All by myself, alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

So they tranquilized me, analyzed me, threw me back in my cage
Then they tied me to an IV, told me I was insane
I'm a prisoner, a visitor inside of my brain
And no matter what I do, they try to keep me in chains

Sometimes I think too much, yeah, I get so caught up
I'm always stuck in my head
I wish I could escape, I tried to yesterday
Took all the sheets off my bed

Then I tied up my linen with five strips of ribbon I found
Scaled the side of the building
I ran to the hills till they found me
And they put me back in my cell
All by myself, alone with my thoughts again
Guess my mind is a prison and I'm never gonna get out

Said even if it's true, no matter what I do
I'm never gonna escape
I won't give up on hope, secure another rope
And try for another day
Said even if it's true, no matter what I do

You are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
All that I am, I am because of you

Because of you

712,All Time Low,2009.0,A Party Song (The Walk Of Shame),"""Nothing Personal""","

I took a walk for the very first time on the dark side of the dance floor,
Lit a match just to heat things up but I got more than I bargained for;

Mixed drinks, mixed feelings of elation,
I should have known it was a one night invitation.

Don't sweat it, forget it, everything is a-ok.
Just let it, go then it's, off to find another face,
I make you come just to watch you leave,
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve.
Don't sweat it, it's over now, our time ran out.

I took an oath, but I'm giving it up, you didn't have to see things my way.
Nothing more than a casual fuck - isn't that just how we operate.

Let's drink to feelings of temptation
You and I, we're an over-night sensation.

Don't sweat it, forget it, everything is a-ok.
Just let it, go then it's, off to find another face,
I make you come just to watch you leave,
I walk around with your heart on my sleeve.
Don't sweat it, it's over now, our time ran...

Outside, the brake lights started to dim,
I feel the tension that's been pulling us in.
And then we do it again, so we can feel alright.
Falling in love for the night.

Don't sweat it, forget it, everything is a-ok.
Just let it, go then it's, off to find another face,
I make you come just to watch you leave,
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve.
Don't sweat it, it's over now, our time ran out.
Our time ran out,
Our time ran out,
Our time ran out.

How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name
I know the way I feel for you
It's now or never
The more I love the more that L'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever
Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends

I know the way I feel for you
It's now or never!

The more I love the more that I'm afraid

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

I can't find my love
No matter how hard I try
She's giving me the runaround
Makes me want to lay down and cry

Come on back to me right now
'Cos you don't have to stay away
I don't play no hide and seek
It's not a game I want to play

Traveling around the world
Trying to find a perfect mate
I found myself a little girl
But now she's started running away

Come on back to me right now
Don't wait til they unleash the hounds
If you don't get back today
They'll follow your trail and hunt you down

Life's a basket but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked since I was born
Born to follow you wherever you go
But my problem is I never do know
Where you're taking me I don't have a clue
I've been naked since I was born

Save my soul and set it free
Free to fly home
There's a place I'm meant to be
Back, back home

I've been broken in so many places
Put together by a sea of faces
What to make of them I don't hardly know
I've been naked for so long, so long

A place where there is money, a place where there is greed
To bring us all together as a happy family

And everything you know is just the price you choose to pay

She was living in a perfect house
With pictures of smiling faces
But there's a different story told inside
Underneath it all
With the sunglasses and makeup on
Blaming the stairs at Macy's
They all knew?
(no one even asked; is something wrong?)
So they wait
Now she's gone?

I don't understand the concept of
The power of one is stronger
Why don't people seem to care at all
As long as it's not about them

I guess we've underestimated love
Or why would we hurt each other
Don't you find that ironical
When love is all we need
Oh yeah?

He is living down his sunset strip
Singing the blues for money
It's easy just to look the other way
When you have it all
He's reaching out to find a helping hand
But nobody seems to bother
Hear them say?
(It's not my problem so it's not my call)
You're on your own
Through it all?

I don't understand the concept of
The power of one is stronger

Or why would we hurt each other

When love is all we need

When all becomes too real
We have a tendency to be
To scared to face it
It's breaking my heart to see?
When love is all we neeeeeeeeed?

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love
The power of love

Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The power of love

As I look into your eyes

And I don't, and I don't know where to start

That made you turn the other way in bed
In this bed
You've been whispering words under your breath
Wish I knew the thoughts inside your head
In your head

Smile when you're sad

When you're mad and you don't wanna talk it over
But this just isn't that

Do you wanna sit there in this hurt?

Smile when you're sad

5962,Michael Jackson,,Shout,,"

Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?

Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.

So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page

Living encased like animals and cannibals
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now

Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality

Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn

How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine

We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever

Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is building and I've had enough

I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now

With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real? Yeah, baby

Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

With all the voices I've heard, something has died
And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby

Ramblin' outa the wild West
Leavin' the towns I love the best
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
'Til I come into New York town
People goin' down to the ground
Buildings goin' up to the sky

Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowin' snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn't feel so cold then

I swung onto my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”

Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved m' sound
He was ravin' about how he loved m' sound
Dollar a day's worth

And after weeks and weeks of hangin' around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid m' dues

Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn't take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin' about
A lot of people don't have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks 'n' knives
And they gotta cut somethin'

So one mornin' when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York

This is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite no
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now cos I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He saw my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing's gonna stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I won't know how
Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody see and save a heart
Come and rescue me now cos I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I would know how

Listen, I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said, ""Hey, I didn't want it to be something.""
You deserve much better for the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it, but girl, I swear

That I got love for you, big love for you

I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right

Where the um---where the fuck is my nunchuck?

Somebody sleepin' in my bed like Nokio
I'm gettin' ill, I been poppin' a pill again
I'm on an Island, and I'm lookin' for Gilligan
Where my Timberland? I got 'em tremblin'
Can't find my keys, but I know, I hear them jingling
You're such a Marilyn – Monroe and Manson
I'm got some heroin, wanna go dancing?
You at the door? Ok, I'm about to come down
I'm getting numb now, don't let me come down

Sniffing on some good blow (Nicki Minaj!)
It's like I'm sippin' on the tempo
And I can't come down now (It's the president y'all and that's the mistress)
Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

Young Moola, baby! (Yeaaah!)

I come through this bitch, wrist bluer, than 'cuz'
I'm so five star, Soo Woo to the bloods
And before I had a mirror, I knew who I was
I know where I'm goin', I knew where I was
Yeah, d-d-d-dirty, dirty south, see my shoe full of mud
Baby who can you trust? Who can you love?
When love kills, like somebody gave Cupid a gun?
It go (BAW!) Like you shooting for fun
And sometimes the solution is execution for some
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one –
A.M. and the conclusion, is you losing a son
No inducing my funds, I smoke the fruitiest blunts
I mean the stupidest buds, I get stupid as duh
I swear my doobie is uh – fat, and just like it, you can get lit
Shit don't stank, when you shittin' in the bank
When her man run an errand, I'ma hit her like Hank
Look him in the eye and a nigga might blink
Aim at his brain and a nigga might think
Weezy

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don’t fool again

He thinks the answer’s cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He’s been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
“I do believe”

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
“I do believe”
“I do believe”

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She’s been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
“I do believe”

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,

Re-introduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah, I've been running, but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You make my heartbeat keep pumping, why the hell you turn it up so loud?

'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

I went in all the way, I thought I could get in and out
She said, ""Relax, you gonna be here for a while.""
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is, I'm learning to love it and I ain't gonna turn it down

'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

[Chorus:]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

I want to know you
Not like that
I don't want to be your mother
I don't want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to be your baby
Kiss me, that's right, kiss me

[Chorus]

Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
Talk to me - tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!

Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby

[Chorus]

I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
To justify my love
Wanting, to justify
Waiting, to justify my love
Praying, to justify
To justify my love
I'm open, to justify my love

A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal

Criminal
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
Hate fags? The answer's ""yes""

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfucking balls
You'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em

""Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail.""
Get it? Checking the 'male'?

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an ""amen"". A-men!

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink more liquor
To fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word
My morals went ... when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me
You won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
""The Maniac's in"" in place of the doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather
So I'm taking his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waiting on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
Aha?
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Go, go, go!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal

These people think it's a crime

To assault when all eyes are on you

It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

Avicii
Mr. Worldwide

I’ve been around the world
And I can’t stop hearing this song
I’ve been around the world
And I can’t stop hearing this song
And I love it

[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
[repeated]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Life’s not waiting for a storm
It’s about dancing in the rain
And if it rains lemons
Learn how to make lemonade
Morale of a story
No problems, just solutions
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have takeoff, Houston
I’m not them boys that they used to
I got 4 million views collected on YouTube
I grew up around Jesus, coke and thick girls
And that inspired me to be a G note speaker
2 thinks guaranteed, definitely actions
They say the devil’s in the details and I won’t ask this
We got the maker
We got a dream, it’s simple
Live it, wake up

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down, whoa

I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain
Steady trying to move this mountain
So, baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

Baby, baby
Whoa, yeah

Well, when you're sitting there
In your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folks that you know
Well I hope you won't see me
In my ragged company
You know I could never be alone

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the US mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Well, when you're sitting back
In your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
I'll be in my basement room
With a needle and a spoon
And another girl to take my pain away

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the US mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

When the lights are dim and your heart is racing as your fingers touch his skin

Where the shock sets in, and the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick

You heard about Pharaoh's army
Tramplin' through the mud
You heard about the Hebrew children
Redeemed by blood
Same spirit dwellin' in you
That raised Christ from the dead
You can quicken your mortal body
Then let it run to your head

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down (cover down, break through)

May need protection
By the armour of the Lord
The sword of God is sharper
Than any double sided sword
(He's the hammer of salvation)
(The blade of righteousness)
(Genesis to revelation)
(Repent and confess)

Cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down (cover down, break through)

Well, you wake up early in the mornin'
Turnin' from a-side to side
Somethin' givin' you a warning
You can run but you can't hide
Demands are laid upon you
And burdens a-you can't bear
Sins you can't even remember
are waiting to meet you there

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, cover down, break through

You've got an image of yourself
You've built by yourself alone
But it will come a-tumblin' down
Just like the walls are made of stone
You will be separated
From everything you seem to be
You think you'll be liberated
Yeah, but the grave won't set you free

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, cover down, break through

It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

Ooh I thought I'd die in your arms

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there

[Spoken:]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away

[Spoken:]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Spoken:]
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone

And wont accept gifts from me

Here they come
Every night the same
Silent stars
Light from a distant flame
Just like the memories of you
That I hold inside
I see you touch
But all the warmth has died

Empty rooms
Crowded by the past 
Time is my enemy
Days keep moving faster
But the nights alone can be
An eternity
That never heals the scars
Of foolish pride

If only you could see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
That you alone can break
And you would free me now
Your heart would come undone
Just looking at me once
And my love would bring you back
If only you could see me now

Here I am
Stranger to a smile
Trying to fight the tears
Missing by a mile
I'm not the one who laughed at you
On that yesterday
When you warned me not to throw your love away

If you could only see me now
Goodbye is not so easy now
The freedom that I walked away to gain
Is nothing but these chains
I know your heart would break 
If you could hear me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could hear me once
Hoping love will bring you back
If only you could see me now

Like the lonely moon
You see above
That sails the dark alone
Forever
I have no light of my own
Other the love we've known
So long ago
Together

If you could feel me now
Your heart would come undone
If you could touch me once
I know love will bring you back
If only you could see me now

Carry me away once more.

And she's playing on my slide trombone.

Fully loaded Tommy gun.

If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.

I am going up
I am going all the way through the fire
I get up and go higher 
So please don’t bring me down
And nothing is gonna bring me down
I am going all the way thru the fire
I will get up and then go higher
So please don’t knock me down
And nothing is gonna knock me down

Now I ain’t got no kids yet,
But this one here is for practice
I hate to get the seats in Benz wet.
But that’s how good your ass is.
Make an old man get his glasses.
Make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow ur moves all weak on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga consider.
You rocking now with the best Mayne. (man)
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag but the boy has been blessed with the blessed mayne
Let you play with the stick ovechkayne.
She’s calling, she’s texting
She’s falling but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend 
Skate girl
Cauz a nigga don’t play them ex games.
No! Straight sexing
No handcuffs or arresting
And I ain’t coming off my last name.
Cauz I really can’t take no stressing
Bout where I done been
Who I done hit
Your home girl saying 
He’s a bad boy
Bout where I done been
Who I done hit
Your home girl saying 
He’s a bad boy

She said
I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good
And every body knows

I can’t get enough of what you got
Good god
You hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not
So don’t you stop I need that

Hey globetrotter,
Cole hotter
Either way
Out in London town
Hoes holla Cauz they love my sound
And I got love for the underground.
Kweli pimp C hot town
Where bun gets down
Met a bad bitch 
That’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night
You just, cut off lights
Never fuss or fight 
Almost missed my flight
Tryna give my last girl a nut
All Right?
She be down for whatever 
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts
All Right?

On the grynd tryna find
This lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Chorus]
I am going up
I am going all the way through the fire
I get up and go higher 
So please don’t bring me down
And nothing is gonna bring me down
I am going all the way thru the fire
I will get up and still get higher
So please don’t knock me down
And nothing is gonna knock me down 

[Eminem]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we are dealt
We have to take these cards ourselves
And flip them. Don’t expect no help
Now I could have 
Either just
Sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I am placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the posch hoped and prayed 
For a dad to show who never did
I just wanted to fit in
At every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it means acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making
That face it’ll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I am just standing
There holding
My tongue tryna talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue 
On that
Frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
Cauz I wasn’t tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cauz where you see it from where you are sitting
Its probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes
At least 
What size you wear??
I wear tens
Let’s see if you can fit your feet

[Chorus]
I am going up
I am going all the way through the fire
I get up and go higher 
So please don’t bring me down
And nothing is gonna bring me down
I am going all the way thru the fire
I will get up and then go higher
So please don’t knock me down
And nothing is gonna knock me down

Somewhere out in empty space, 
long before the human race,
Something stirred,
A vast and timeless source began,
Intelligence was born and then, 
there was the world,
Powers filled the universe, 
matter formed and broke the curse,
Of nothingness,
Love became an ageless soul, 
nature reached her highest goal,
And breathed the breath of life,
Everlasting life.
Well creatures come from out of sight,
Daylight came from in the night, 
and all was good,
Life became a masterplan,
Love produced the perfect man, 
that understood,
The image of the makers word, 
worshipped him with all he had,
But then one day,
From in the depths an evil seed, 
grew and manufactured greed,
That changed the way of life,
Everlasting life,
Oh the loving power looked and saw,
Inside the heart of man a flaw, 
began to grow,
Well, the fires of hell began to burn, 
and so he sent his chosen son,
To let us know,
That love had surely made us all, 
and hate would surely make us fall,
So from the cross,
Well he showed the world that dreadful day,
That love could be the only way, 
or all is lost of life,
Everlasting life,
For life is love,
And love is life.

The things I whisper in your ear (What?)
I said,

""I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better.)
Than anything you've ever had
(Than anything I've ever had.)
A stronger and a faster lover
(a stronger and a faster lover)
The world, it disappears so fast

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins

I can't wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails

Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere

Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?
Don't think that I can wait

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins, hey, yeah

I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: Let it be me.

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling someone
Now and forever, let it be me.

Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be ?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me.

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right

Seeing through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays

And then we'll go all night

Two stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me

I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best, and the rest are just less
Than she needs, so we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays

And we'll go all night

Two stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down you just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on the side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you? Good luck""
But you don't mean it
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand it's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is to see you

Made your acquaintance late one night
You were floating around
You know you gave me quite a fright
You didn't seem like an ordinary man
More like a ray of light

You transcendentally imposed yourself upon my bed
You know you didn't say very much
I'm out of body and I feel so good in my head
You know I'm really quite touched

I wake up with your fragrance and it's all over me
What cologne do you wear?
I walk around with a smile on my face, 'cause you're close to me
Well I know you're somewhere

[Chorus:]

Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

I stay uplifted for quite some time
(or: You say you've lived here for quite some time)
And I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined
You know just what I want and I don't have to ask
Are you reading my mind?

You're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare
You're not the least bit obsessed with your hair
You're not upset when I come home later than ten
For a ghost you're a very good friend

[Bridge:]

I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

[chorus, repeat]

I can't see you (so hot)
I know you're out there you little rascal
Stop that

Gonna take my pants off for a different kind of romance

It's outrageously large

You hop into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark;

Out of the car long hair, oowee

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

New York City

Who you know fresher than Nick'? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn, but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go ""Ew""?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to roar

After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

[Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park:]
Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Nicki Minaj:]
Can I get an encore
I know you want more
(I've become so numb)
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar

Well, when I walk, when I walk,
Walk my horse upon a hill.
Well, when I walk, walk, walk, walk,
Walk my horse upon a hill.
When I lay me down,
Will my lover love me still?

A dog is here,
A dog is there,
My dog he got three legs
But he can't run.

Well, when I thought, well, I thought,
When I thought you was my friend.
When I thought, well, I thought,
When I thought you was my friend.
But you let me down, ho,
Put my heart around the bend.

A fly flies in,
A fly flies out,
Most flies they got three legs
But mine got one.

Well, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly,
When I fly above the clouds.
Oh, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly,
When I fly above the clouds.
You can knock me down, with a feather, yes, you could,
But you know it's not allowed.

A dog is here,

My dog he got three legs

My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none, uh, uh, uh,
My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none,

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
That skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)

(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece

We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)

Doubt, it can close you in
Build the walls within
I let fear control me
And that girl didn't know
Where the answer would be

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking for it somehow
Somewhere we couldn't see

But the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

Ummm

Faith, it can lift you up
And if you got enough
To reach a new beginning

Love, can withstand strong
In the final hour
We'll find the joy in living

Don't let go
Cause that I know
Pretty soon you will see

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking for it somehow
Somewhere we couldn't see

But the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere

There's safety in your arms
Where you'll go I'll follow

In hearts that are listening like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

From too much talk to loving touches
Love touches

With things he can see but he just cannot touch.

You show emotion but you hide what you feel
You play the innocent but I've watched you steal

You seduced me with your easy charm
And I must admit I could fall for it

But I must resist there's no point to this

But if love is out the question

Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this, like this

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, colour the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high that's why

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, colour the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

I can take away your scars

3781,Elvis Presley,1960.0,Mansion Over The Hilltop,"""His Hand In Mine""","

I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one that's silver lined

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged I'm heaven bound
I'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
I want a mansion, a harp and a crown

I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold

I remember when your head caught flame

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living

Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong but nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again

I know there must be other ways
Of feeling free
But this is what I wanna do
Who I wanna be

I can see my body through
Windows in my hair

Gliding through the air

I know nobody's dancing here

[Sample - Rock Therapy ""Reaching Out"":]
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?

[Eminem:]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
""Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn""
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

Aunt Edna always told me ""Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?

So oh oh

[Eminem:]
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

So here we are
Like we were
Two feet apart
In different worlds
No need to say
Another word
No, I should leave
But I don't wanna go just yet
'Cause I'm not really over it

You remind my heart
Of a lie I wish you never told
But it's all I've got
Just five more minutes and I'm gone
Same old song like an echo, ooh
'Cause I know I'm better off alone
It is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go

Now that I know the way it ends
The words we chose, irrelevant
Let's just pretend a little bit
I know I should leave but
I don't wanna go just yet

All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
Oh, to make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my days
And try to find my ways to the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues, ooh

Everywhere I'd go, I see you

2470,Barbra Streisand,2012.0,Home,"compilation: ""Release Me""","

When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall they have a meaning
Sprinkling the scene
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to go
To know if we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away? should we try and stay?
Or would it be better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like Home

My friends smiling down on me, giving me nursery.
I think of a peaceful world enjoy all around me
Love like we shared can never be taken away from me
I just sit down and it get's all down in my bones
I hear my friends telling me, ""Stephanie, please sing my song""
I wanna sing, I wanna shout, I wanna tell you what it's all about.

In politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels.""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'

Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word ""fucking"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll

Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid

When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice

Come on, come on, don't stop a-running with me
Come on, come on, don't stop a-running…

He's throwing his hands up to the sky
How many more ways are there to say this
He's wondering how many more times
Will we all bear witness

And can't you feel the temperature rising?
'Cause we've never felt a heat like this before
And can't you see it on the horizon
Then he opens up his questions to the floor

Would it keep you awake if it all didn't just seem so far away?
'Cause it keeps me awake trying to work this out until my dying day
It's always you standing in our way
It's always you that's leading us astray

It takes a big man to cry on screen
Delivering words that fall on deaf ears
It's such a big wheel to try and turn
But in his final hour it's worth it

And can't you feel the temperature rising?
'Cause we've never felt a heat like this before
And can't you see it on the horizon
Then he opens up his questions to the floor

Would it keep you awake if it all didn't just seem so far away?
'Cause it keeps me awake trying to work this out until my dying day

It's always you that's leading us astray

Come on, come on, don't stop a-running with me
Come on, come on, don't stop a-running…

Would it keep you awake if the waters rise and took your house away?
Would it keep you awake if the gun you love was turned at you one day?
It's always you standing in our way
It's always you that's leading us astray

You are always… You are always leading us astray

I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won't remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother

I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar

I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile

And your kiss

When it is late at night
It'll show me your shadow

Hope you remember
When summer's gone
I'll still sing a song
Of you in September

Oooh... the Pyramid's gone..isn't that Nice
you See the Stars
Isn't that Nice
Yeah.. You have to turn it all off
And Stop.. Take the time to let yourself unwind
Make the time for Simple Pleasures
Turn Away from All the Chaos and confusion
of a World that's spinning out of it's mind

Yes Stop,
Look Around but this time really see
All the Colors of the Sky
Hurry Less, Linger More
Maybe then you'll find.. as you're rushing life
Is rushing By...

Give yourself the gift of a quiet afternoon
Call a friend you haven't seen for ages...
Curl up with a book in a cozy corner
Happy getting lost in it's pages
Walk along the shore
leave your footprints in the sand
Sip a cup a Cocoa on a Winter night
Make a Baby squeal with Laughter
feel the Joy that follows after
to your Hearts delight... 
So...

Go on and take a breath
just turn off the noise
and you will hear the music play
Candle Light, a Chocolate Bar, a Kiss Goodnight
and there you are
With Simple Pleasures Everyday...

You kiss me,
And with your kiss the world begins
You're Spring to me,

Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow

Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs

Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish

See if I stand firm or if i fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue is the answer to you

Everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black

Ohhhhh

Yeah everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
Oh, you cannot take it back
Cause there's many shades of black
You have many shades of black
You have many, you have many shades of black
Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Morning glow, morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due

Morning glow fill the earth
Come on shine far all you're worth
We'll be present at the birth
Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago

Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago

Morning glow all of your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London

Yo, I do deals but I never get twanged
Moves that ain't ever been planned
Know goons that were never in gangs
Where I'm from chat shit get banged
Where I'm from chat shit, let the 12-gauge rip
Yeah, sick how it fits in my hand
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam
Or these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef a grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time-keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride, shoot a guy
Leave you wet like you scuba dive
You were younger then, and now we're unified
South London boys get you crucified
I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things
They just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time
Yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the divide tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back in the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London Town, right now

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (woop woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceiling low (ceiling low)
Sweat brow dripping down when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (they don't)
So take me back to London

Yo when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top-ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock 5970 daily
But I want soul
I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowing up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazing flows
Grime or rap, man, I give 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow and went global, man
Now the case is closed

2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years you'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
And when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto' (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceiling low (ceiling low)
Sweat brow dripping down when in Rome (when in Rome)

Before you go, walk out on me
Take a look around, tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here, you might have overlooked

'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a-while

It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart

So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best

If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Nicki Minaj:]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)

[Chorus:]
Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down eat you alive
Just like animals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals
Baby I'm-

So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no

[Chorus]

So if I run it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Don't tell no lies, you can't deny
The beast inside
No girl don't lie, you can't deny
The beast inside
Just like animals
Just like animals

This is pain, this is love
This is sent from above
This a gift from the Gods
This was meant to be
You can run, you can hide
You can front, you can lie
But in time you gon' find you was meant for me
You apart of me and I'm apart of you
I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through
I need a fix like d-boys need bricks
And plus whips to transport 'em
J. Cole, I seen it tall, you can't short 'em
One more time together
I hope your new man don't mind, girl you're mine forever

Okay, Sheila. Why don't you tell me about your parents.

My parents?

Yeah.

[Sheila:]
Well, my mother was a ballerina until my father made her quit.

[Auditioner:]
Really?

[Sheila:]
Really.

[Auditioner:]
Tell me more.

[Sheila:]
Tell you more?

Daddy always thought that he married beneath him
That's what he said, that's what he said
When he proposed he informed my mother
He was probably her very last chance

And though she was twenty-two
Though she was twenty-two
Though she was twenty-two
She married him

Life with my dad wasn't ever a picnic
More like a ""come as you are.""
When I was five I remember my mother
Dug earrings out of the car
I knew they weren't hers, but it wasn't
Something you'd want to discuss

He wasn't warm
Well, not to her
Well, not to us
Come to think of it

But
Everything was beautiful at the ballet
Graceful men lift lovely girls in white
Yes
Everything was beautiful at ballet
Hey!
I was happy at the ballet

That's when I started class

[Together:]
Up a steep and very narrow stairway
To the voice like a metronome
Up a steep and very narrow stairway

I don't know what you mean.

[Auditioner:]
Okay. On the subject of mothers what about yours?

[Bebe:]
My mother?

[Auditioner:]
Yes, yours.

[Bebe:]
She lied to me.

[Auditioner:]
She lied to you?

[Bebe:]
Mother always said I'd be very attractive
When I grew up, when I grew up
""Diff'rent,"" she said, ""With a special something
And a very, very personal flair.""

And though I was eight or nine
Though I was eight or nine
Though I was eight or nine
I hated her

Now
""Diff'rent"" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty
""Pretty"" is what it's about
I never met anyone who was ""diff'rent""
Who couldn't figure that out

So beautiful I'd never live to see
But it was clear

If not to her
Well then to me

[Together:]
That everyone is beautiful at the ballet
Every prince has got to have his swan

Hey!

Alright, Number Six.

[Maggie:]
Number Six that's me, Maggie. Can I tell you about my parents?
I don't know what they were for or against, really, except each other
I mean, I was born to save their marriage
But when my father came to pick my mother up at the hospital he said
""Well, I thought this was going to help
But I guess it's not.""
Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life
I used to dance around the living room with my arms up like this
My fantasy was that it was an Indian Chief
And he'd say to me
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?""
And I'd say, ""Daddy, I would love to dance.""

But it was clear

When he proposed

That I was born to help their marriage and when

[Sheila:]
That's what he said

[Bebe:]
That's what she said

[Maggie:]
I used to dance around the living room

[Sheila:]
He wasn't warm

[Bebe:]
Not to her

(""Do-do-doo's"")

[Maggie:]
It was an Indian chief and he'd say
""Maggie, do you wanna dance?""
And I said, ""Daddy, I would love to""

Everything was beautiful at the ballet
Raise your arms and someone's always there
Everything was beautiful at the ballet

Yes everything was beautiful at the ballet

Hey!

[Stormzy:]
Check it
I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my songs until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour up your liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
Baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I won't be talking on Twitter, girl, that is dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm in love with the shape of you

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might've thought we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it and I want it so bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah let's be clear, I trust no one

You will not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Well I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I walked through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You will not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band and when you pull too hard
Well I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

Lala da da da da da da
Lala da da da da da da
Lala da da da da da da

Cause I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band and when you pull too hard
Well I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp

Well I may snap and I move fast
You won't see me fall apart
Cause I've got an elastic heart

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged good-bye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room

Tell me how you feel over and done with

Of great times with far better people
And weekends with our friends
Laughing about the wine that stains their teeth
We’ll talk about how your parents separated and
How you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out
And trying to feel forever young

Nation to nation
All the world
Must come together
Face the problems
That we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor
For a favor

What has come of

Have we lost love
Of what it's about

I have to find my peace cuz
No one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom

Rearranging minds

Don't you ask me
For no favors
I'm conditioned by
The system
Don't you talk to me
Don't scream and shout

She pray to god, to Buddha
Then she sings a
Talmud song
Confusions contradict
The self
Do we know right

Recognize me

You can't hurt me

Visions of yesterday,
How fast they slip away

Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again

And if I drift outside myself
Please don't turn away

I've lost along the way
Come join me in my fantasy
Step out of space and time
There's only one thing left to do

Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again

Afraid of the big, wide world

There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don't you worry just

And walking on cold thin ice

Start screaming, is there someone out there?

In Scarlet Town, where I was born
There's ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you can't pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, ""Are you going my way? ""
Uncle Tom still workin' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill.

Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissin' his face and heapin' prayers on his head
So brave, so true, so gentle is he
I'll weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come your blow horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours,
There's palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good livin' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
There's walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town cryin' won't do no good

In Scarlet Town, you fight your father's foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
You've got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didn't do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
You'll wish to God that you stayed right here

Set 'em Joe, play ""Walkin' the Floor""
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
I'm staying up late, I'm making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
It's all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town
"
2760,Bob Dylan,1985.0,Never Gonna Be The Same Again,"""Empire Burlesque""","

Now you're here beside me, baby
You're a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see ya
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving
I'd just like it to be my idea.

You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I can't go back to what was, baby
I can't unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.

Come on, baby
Come on, darlin'
You're too hot, darlin'
Come on, baby
Come on, honey
You're my baby
You're my honey
You got it baby
Come on, baby.

[Eminem:]
Here we go again from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-elope would be dope
But what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in; I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's probably screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, ""Marshall, what a skank I've been!
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him""
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays, like when you get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream ""Fuck you!""
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since

[Jessie Reyez:]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
They like, ""You're the good guy,"" they like, they like
They like, ""You're the good guy""

In your room
Where time stands still
Or moves at your will
Will you let the morning come soon
Or will you leave me lying here
In your favourite darkness
Your favourite half-light
Your favourite consciousness
Your favourite slave

In your room
Where souls disappear
Only you exist here
Will you lead me to your armchair
Or leave me lying here
Your favourite innocence
Your favourite prize
Your favourite smile
Your favourite slave

I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here

In your room
Your burning eyes
Cause flames to arise
Will you let the fire die down soon
Or will I always be here
Your favourite passion
Your favourite game
Your favourite mirror
Your favourite slave

Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin

They call you Jezebel
Whenever we walk in
You're going straight to hell
For wanton acts of sin
They say
And that I'll have to pay
But I need you
Just this way

They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
You're morally unwell
They say you'll never care
For me
But what they fail to see
Is that your games
Are the key

Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea
That you don't own someone

They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes
Is real
And how you really feel
But they can't see
Your appeal

Jezebel!

4856,Guns N' Roses,1991.0,Don't Damn Me,"""Use Your Illusion I""","

Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words, once heard, they can place you in a faction
My words may disturb, but at least there's a reaction
Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah
Sometimes I wanna kill, sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even, sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give, sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while, I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen, didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world, I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely, I fell down when I was blind

So, don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you?
And how can I ever make you see that
Deep inside, we're all somebody
And it don't matter who you, you wanna be?

But now I gotta smile, I hope you comprehend
For, this man can say it happened 'cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world, I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime

But look at what we've done to the innocent and young
Whoa, listen to who's talking 'cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
Said, it tears into our conscious thoughts, you tell me, who's to blame?

I know you don't wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusion
But your delusions are yours, and not mine
We take for granted, we know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover and read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me and don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my intentions, can you find the missing link?
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time

So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do, intending just to please
If I damned your point of view, could you turn the other cheek?

Oh
Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I've been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

Don't damn me
I said, don't damn me
I said, don't hail me
Ah, don't damn me
Ouh

Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Alright, that sucked

As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden 
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine 
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain 
Someone hit me from behind 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Through this weary world of woe 
Heart burning, still yearning 
No one on earth would ever know 

They say prayer has the power to heal 
So pray for me, mother 
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell 
I am trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others 
But oh, mother, things ain't going well 

Ain't talking, just walking 
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross 
Heart burning, still yearning 
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost 

Now I'm all worn down by weeping 
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry 
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping 
I'll just slaughter them where they lie 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Through the world mysterious and vague 
Heart burning, still yearning 
Walking through the cities of the plague. 

Well, the whole world is filled with speculation 
The whole wide world which people say is round 
They will tear your mind away from contemplation 
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Eating hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town. 
Heart burning, still yearning 
Some day you'll be glad to have me around. 

They will crush you with wealth and power 
Every waking moment you could crack 
I'll make the most of one last extra hour 
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Hand me down my walking cane. 
Heart burning, still yearning 
Got to get you out of my miserable brain. 

All my loyal and my much-loved companions 
They approve of me and share my code 
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned 
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road 

Ain't talking, just walking 
My mule is sick, my horse is blind. 
Heart burning, still yearning 
Thinking about that girl I left behind. 

Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying 
Fame and honor never seem to fade 
The fire gone out but the light is never dying 
Who says I can't get heavenly aid? 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Carrying a dead man's shield 
Heart burning, still yearning 
Walking with an ache in my heel 

The suffering is unending 
Every nook and cranny has its tears 
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending 
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Walking ever since the other night. 
Heart burning, still yearning 
Walking until I'm clean out of sight. 

As I walked out in the mystic garden 
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn 
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon 
There's no one here, the gardener is gone 

Ain't talking, just walking 
Up the road, around the bend. 
Heart burning, still yearning 
In the last outback at the world's end.

Yo, check this here

And make it cold cold, sexy, you know?

Spend some quality time, and
You make me wanna cha, cha, cha, ah, cha, cha
Yeah, right there, just keep it right there
And I know you're gonna like it
Ooh baby, you sure love to
Know what I'm saying

We've been hanging out every day this week
How 'bout a nigga fix you something to eat
And just chill, we ain't gotta wild out, just chill
Parlay, little momma, right here
Sipping on chardonnay, slip on that Vicki Secret lingerie
'Cause I ain't trying to throw my money away (in the streets)
If I can see you twork it out for me

Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out

Now that I got you all soaking wet
I bet you know what's coming next

Oh baby, let me tell you how
What do you think about me
Tworkin' you from your front to your back end?
Kick back and relax
Come sit up on my lap, shorty
Tonight, I'm taking you all the way
Won't stop until you scream my name

Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love

Morning is coming and I don't want to let you go
Let's just lay here in this bed of red rose petals
I know that we're spent, but one kiss can make this start all over again
If you want it, baby, come with me

It's way too trill
The way you making me feel
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby, you sure love to ball

3542,Ed Sheeran,2017.0,Supermarket Flowers,"""÷""","

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved

Took the ""Get Well Soon"" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go 
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back, he said, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
It's over
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
When it's over
And we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all around was turning
And we were cruising for the ride
Gotta give a little of the love inside
Not to take it all and watch me fall
I got me lovin' you
I had you lovin' me
And we both played along
Love is easy on the young
Life was together
As the world fades away into yesterday
I'm losing you , forever
I'm just an empty shell
With nothing for tomorrow
I'm here to face the sorrow
The dream we sailed was far and wide
Gotta give a little of the love inside
Not to take apart this breaking heart
I got me lovin' you
I had you lovin' me
So the word is goodbye
Makes no difference how the tears are cried
It's over
And my heart lives alone
I can make believe you need me
When it's over
And we can't take it home
The fire that was burning
When all around was turning
The dream we sailed was far and wide

Gotta give a little of the love inside

I never found out why you walked away
And never said good-bye
But now that I see you
I'm torn inside, but I've still got my pride

I understand that some things are better left unsaid
I'm afraid of the truth
But what can I do if I still want you

If we could start over again
I know if we try our love could be stronger
If we could start over again
I'm sure, we oh
We'd never have to let go

For so many years now
I've held inside things I meant to say
But faced with the past now I realize
I can't let that stand in our way

I never knew that a love so strong would never fade
But what can we do
If I still want you
And you want me too

How can we walk away
From something that was once so strong
Have we the strength to say we're wrong

Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I sow
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go

I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will loneliness be over

Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same

I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

Loneliness be over
When will loneliness be over
Loneliness be over
When will loneliness be over

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Hush now

I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

A new day has... come

Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

Hush now

Oh, it's almost blinding me

When I was younger
I would argue with my dad
Tell him that I hated him when I was talking back
Blocked his number
Can't believe that I did that
Oh, I didn't have a reason, wish that I could take it back
But as the years went by
He was always by my side
To wipe all of the tears I cried

Now that I'm older, realized my father
Was doing the best he could do
Told him one day I'll have a son or a daughter
And when I'm a father too, I hope that I am just like you

I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you
I hope that I am just like you

Now I realize that he has struggles of his own
How could I be so selfish, oh, how could I block his phone?
Now I remember when my father lost his job
How he held a home together, for the family he was strong
And as the years went by
He was always by my side
To wipe all of the tears I cried

Now that I'm older, realized my father
Was doing the best he could do
Told him one day I'll have a son or a daughter
And when I'm a father too, I hope that I am just like you

A little extra something
To kinda see them through
Nothing turns the day on
Or really gets it dawning

Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythms right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free

She was my baby
Te quiero, I love you
Say goodbye, say goodbye

Don't go away
Stay by my side

Running around chasing hearts
Chasing bodies to fix the parts
I don't know how I reached this place
So far from heaven, so far from grace

Am I wrong to give in to the pressure?
Cause I feel like the city's got the better of me
Oh, this casual love isn't what it seems
And I try to imagine something closer
And somebody who is good for me
I'm so tired of all this searching
Do I, do I, do I, do I

Go home to nothing or stay out for more?
Give in to someone or lock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows, drown them like before?
I'm drowning shadows once more

The more I drink, the more I drown
If I'm not thinking, I won't get down
The more I rise above it all
The less I care about the fall

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
Time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you

Oh, darling I guess
My mind's more at ease
But nevertheless
Why bring my memo, why bring my memo,
Why bring my memories.

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for

The way she moves her hips to her fingertips
I feel I'm heaven bound
And when she starts to sway, I've gotta say
She really move the grass around

Rock-a-hula baby
Rock-a-hula baby
Got a hula lulu from Honolulu
That rock-a-hula baby of mine

Although I love to kiss my little hula miss
I never get the chance
I wanna hold her tight all through the night
But all she wants to do is dance

I bet that she could teach the palms along the beach
To sway when breezes blow
And birds up in the sky could learn to fly
By watchin' how my baby can go

They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate.

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring
She was born in spring but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

The sun is welcoming the evening shadows
On a perfect day and the next step is love
The next step is love

We walked barefoot through the misty meadows
Laughing at each other in the rain
Made some faces at some people in the park
Didn't bother to explain
Fun, fun, look at us run
Going nowhere special really fast
But we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
That we've been baking with the past

And the next step is love
So what are we waiting for?
The next step is love
Girl, it's for sure

Love will be a place to run to
From the world they've built to you and me
We'll be closer than we've ever been
Though looking back it's so hard to believe
Hang it all out or bring it all in
The best we've picked upon the way tonight
Changes are coming but together
We can make it through somehow

Yes the next step is love

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh I hope that it won't end though
Alone

[Refrain:]

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

You don't know how long I have wanted
to touch your lips and hold you tight,oh
You don't know how long I have waited
and I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
and my love for you is still unknown
Alone

[Refrain:]

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone

Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers

Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk-tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s, I don't
Even know me, roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s, I don't
Even know me, roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, cause I want, I wanna go home

Oscars and Emmy's and Grammy's
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon, the future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me

Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk-tie tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20s, I don't
Even know me, roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s, I don't
Even know me, roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, cause I want, I wanna go home

Hallucinations only mean
That your brain is on fire
But it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feelin' me
Fade to black if you're not mine
Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

This is my roaring, roaring 20s, I don't
Even know me, roll me a blunt, cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt

This is my roaring, roaring 20s, I don't
Even know me, roll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, cause I want, I wanna go home

Oh-woah
Oh-woah
I wanna go home

Or was it just a dream
I'm a little scared
Knowing you're out there

Since you've been gone
Everyday I miss you more
Now I wanna know
Why did you have to go?
What were you looking for?

And I hope you find your way
But I can't wait to say

You're home now not alone now
These arms are hear to hold you
No need to be afraid
So come in 'cause I've been
Waiting for the moment
To open up this door
And I know that it's not much

Welcome to my heart
Welcome to my heart

Welcome to my heart

So you lost your way
But that's yesterday
And I don't care where you've been
'Cause every step
You've taken since you left
Has brought you back again

And I hope you see it clear
(Oh see it clear)
My love has always been right here

You're home now not alone now

Can we really live without each other?

Where did we lose the touch

It always made me feel so...

I somehow  knew
I'd been the only one
How wonderful the moment
When the boy became a man
You warmed me in the  night
And you taught me
How to feel

And go back there again
We walked away from time
I'd  like to keep the moment
That was mine
I'd like to touch the man
I met just once
Before I go
Oh I've been to many places
And I've opened every door

You’re not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I’m searching for what used to be mine

And I saw your eyes
And I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scarred and left me
Like a sunburn

Don’t drop me in

Tossing and turning,
Somehow I'm learning
Secrets I'd rather not know.
Can't it be simple?

Ghosts that the past left behind.

'Till everything was documented
Our mind it was reaching out
To put into words what their bodies had done

They lie together, oh

And they lie upon her, oh

It's a catalogue of modern mistakes
Her words and legs wrapped around each man
Leaving stories like digital crumbs
As she turns these nights into literature

They lie together, oh

When they leave she sets about writing down
Awkward body games all over town
Warm affection runs through every word
We're screens away but we're laughing with her

I pounded on a farmhouse
Lookin' for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired
I had come a long, long way
I said, ""Hey, hey, in there
Is there anybody home ?
I was standin' on the steps
Feelin' must alone
Well, out comes a farmer
He must have thought that I was nuts
He immediately looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts

I fell down 
To my bended knees
Saying, ""I dig farmers
Don't shoot me please""
He cocked his rifle
And began to shout
""You're that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about""v I said, ""No ! No ! No !
I'm a doctor and it's true
I'm a clean-cut kid
And I been to college too"".

Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had
He said, ""What do doctors
Know about farms, pray tell ?""
I said, ""I was born
At the bottom of a wishing well"".

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie
He said ""I guess, you're tired""
He said, kinds sly
I said, ""Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove""
He said, ""I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove
Just one condition
You got to sleep right now
That you don't touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cow"".

When I heard something jerkin'
There stood Rita
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins
She said, ""Would you like to take a shower ?
I'll show you up to the door""
I said, ""Oh, no, no
I've been through this movie before
I knew I had to split
But I didn't know how
When she said,
""Would you like to take that shower now ?""

Well, I couldn't leave
Unless the old man chased me out
'Cause I'd already promised
That I'd milk his cows
I had to say something
To strike him very weird
So I yelled out
""I like Fidel Castro and his beard""
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin', ""What's that I heard you say ?""

I said, ""I like Fidel Castrov I think you heard me right""
And I ducked as he swung
At me with all his might
Rita mumbled something
'Bout her mother on the hill
As his fist hit the icebox
He said he's going to kill me
If I don't get out of the door
In two seconds flat
""Your unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat"".

Well, he threw a Reader's Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And chrashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers
Rita said, ""Come back""
As he started to load
The sun was comin' up
And I was runnin' down the road.

Well, I don't figure I'll be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel
He still waits for me
Constant on the sky
He wants to turn me in
To the FBI
Me, I romp and stomping
Thankful as a romp
Without freedom of speech
I might be in the swamp.

It isn't by chance I happen to be
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
""Come sit over here"" somebody will call
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!""
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
""Come by for a drink, we're having a game""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of them mine
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
Till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lying in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

While sitting around, we often recall
The laugh of the year, the night of them all
The blonde who was so attractive that year
Some opening night that made us all cheer
Remember that time we all got so tight
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright

With a night that we can't replace
I'm lost but found with you in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase

I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real

So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this

In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

Mmm, in another time

Can't stop myself from falling back into you

Maybe we just need a saving
Come save me

Wonder what we could be living in another life
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above

Taking everything for granted but we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine

One dream in my heart, one love to be living for
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine

Close to my heart she came, only to fly away
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle’s crumbled
And you’re left with just a name

Where’s your crown,

Hot and cold, bought and sold

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak

2886,Bob Dylan,2012.0,Soon After Midnight,"""Tempest""","

I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen

They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They lie and they dine in their blood
Two timing slim
Who's ever heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you'd do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you

Old dream maker, you heart breaker,

Two drifters, off to see the world,
There's such a lot of world to see,
We're after the same rainbows end,
Waitin' round the bend,

Detroit!

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall sea shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The Twin Eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
My pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in Hammer pants
So call it sibling rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ridin' around this block
All we knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?

Shawn Don
(Welcome to Detroit)
Boy I need no half's a half, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where is you get that promotion
Don't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpiring
Boy hit the beat and just treat that shit like it's a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I've never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in a vet
Ha plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm over respected, my mama gated community's over protective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' all listening to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like 50 days away
Tryin' to get paid 50 ways a day
Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a life time a few times
From futons to Grey Poupon's
In church tryin' to get a little savings, yeah coupon
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number like ""you still ain't got a new line?""
Naw it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killas pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Ketteran
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Ghan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refilla a
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC'D the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?
For me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if
I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' it's fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with a two penises
Hateful and genius ness, inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling
May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with ya but ain't shit changin'
And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?
And if they mention us

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'

Detroit!
Okay!

She said, ""Fuck Fendi"", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch, fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up ThisIs50

I ran from my house that cannot contain me
From the man that I cannot keep
From my mother who haunts me, even though she's gone
From my daughter that never sleeps
I ran from the noise and the silence
From the traffic on the streets

I ran to the treetops, I ran to the sky
Out to the lake, into the rain that matted my hair
And soaked my shoes and skin
Hid my tears, hid my fears

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me

I ran past the churches and the crooked old mailbox
Past the apple orchards and the lady that never talks
Up into the hills, I ran to the cemetery
And held my breath, and thought about your death

I ran to the lake, up into the hills
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still
And I saw the crumbling tombstones
All forgotten names

I tasted the rain, I tasted my tears
I cursed the angels, I tasted my fears

And the ground gave way beneath my feet
And the earth took me in her arms
Leaves covered my face
Ants marched across my back
Black sky opened up, blinding me

I ran to the forest, I ran to the trees
I ran and I ran, I was looking for me
I ran to the lakes and up to the hill
I ran and I ran, I'm looking there still

Her rotting bones
Her decay

Everybody's looking for someone to follow
Finding the whole thing hard to swallow
Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's talking about the state of the nation
Everybody's searching for a promised land
Everybody's failing to understand
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a reason to live

Ayo they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doing wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here looking so ungrateful
I'mma keep it moving, be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game
You ain't learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous, and entitled
But they swearing on the Bible that they love you
When really they're no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

Yo, people will love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out the niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in the Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills on 'em

Throw it all away
Let's lose ourselves
'Cause there's no one left for us to blame
It's a shame we're all dying
And do you think you deserve your freedom

How could you send us so far away from home
When you know damn well that this is wrong
I would still lay down my life for you
And do you think you deserve your freedom

No I don't think you do
There's no justice in the world
There's no justice in the world
And there never was

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

The little things you planned
Her memory is with you yet
That's someone you never forget

When she is far away
You'll think of her each day

Others may pass your way
And let you think their love is true
But you know that they'll never replace
The one that waits for you

It's a beautiful life

Keep your beautiful words

'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is

I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe in Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we're not aware of their crimes
We know
But we're just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air
It's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life

I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
I can't take it anymore
I've been hurt before
Never ever quite like this time

What will become of me when you're no longer here?
If I can't stop loving you
What am I to do?
You'll be free but where will I be?

Now that I'm used to love, how can I stand alone?
Now that love has come and gone
Like the ending of a song
A song my lonely heart keeps singing

Where do I go from here? Will I get over you?
If so, next time I'll be smart
I'll know before I start
A heart that don't care, don't get broken

I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
Never ever, never again, never again

It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older

Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I?

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified
I think that I may be losing my mind

Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight

I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry 'cause she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind

I will be back again
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I'm not giving in
I want the world to know
That I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified
I think that I may be losing my mind

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a place to be alone
I'm terrified
I think that I may be losing my mind

Roll up another cigarette
Using a minute that it takes
To think about the power of your words
We're living in the currents you create
We're sinking in the pool of your mistakes
So stub it out, your podium awaits

How can you think you're serious?
Do you even know what year it is?
I can't believe the scary points you make
Still living in the currents you create
Still sinking in the pool of your mistakes
Won't you stop firing up the crazies?

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

You went cold
You got caught
You exceeded my darkest thoughts
A poisoned chalice
Thorn in my side
I'm so numb
From your lies

While you were busy breaking hearts
I was busy breaking
I was giving all my love
You were busy taking
Summer haze of summer wine reminded me of better times
But I let you in my heart
So now it's busy breaking
Now it's busy breaking

Went so far
Down this road
I felt depression deep in my soul
Drug fuelled fights
Ride your lows and highs
We played it all out
Till we died

While you were busy breaking hearts
I was busy breaking
I was giving all my love
You were busy taking
Summer haze of summer wine reminded me of better times

Seems like dreams like I always had
Could be, should be making me glad
Why am I blue?
It's up to you to explain
I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away
Someday, some way, you'll come and say
It's you I need and you'll be pleading in vain

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wondered around, finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad
Thinking of you

Some others I've seen,
Might never be mean, might never be cross,
Or try to be boss, but they wouldn't do
'Cause nobody else gave ma a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, crazy old you, it had to be you

Well, my shoes, they comes from Singapore
My flashlight's from Taiwan
My tablecloth's from Malayisia
My belt buckle's from the Amazon
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy making thirty cents a day.

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way.

Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well, the dog collar's from India
And the flower pot's from Pakistan
All the furniture it said ""Made in Brazil""
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know, that's a lot of money to her.

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way.

Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work
I say, ""Why you say that for
When nothing you got is US made ?""
They don't make nothing here no more
You know, capitalism is above the law
It say, ""it don't count 'less it sells""
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else.

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way.
Well, the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business, friend
And they're going out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas 
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is gonna be against the law.

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way.

Democracy don't rule the world
You'd better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess that's better left unsaid
From Broadway to the Milky Way
That's a lot of territory indeed
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.

Well, it's sundown on the union
And what's made in the USA
Sure was a good idea

So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed

Dressed in black from head to toe
Two guitars across our backs
We would walk the city roads
Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home.

[Chorus:]
But they can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through does early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy

Hair slicked back with vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We will the thrill to never stop

May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always comes to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration long may it last
May it come to you time and time again

Now everybody seems to have their own opinion
Of Who did this and who did that
But as for me I don't see how they can remember
When they weren't where it was at

Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy

You're gonna need three SWATs or police officers at least to come pull me
off of it and I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away

But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop K.Dot to Shady

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

5132,Lorde,,"Yellow Flicker Beat(from ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" soundtrack)",,"

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)

[Chorus:]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colours disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me, I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat

Virgil Caine is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Til stoneman's cavalry
Came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By may the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well

The night they drove old dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old dixie down
And the people were singin'

They went
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
""Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old dixie down
And the people were singin'

Like my father before me
I will work the land
Like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up
When he's in defeat

The first noel the angels did sing
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, noel, noel, noel
Born is the king of israel

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don't want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm

Yeah my life is what I'm fighting for
Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

So pull me up from down below
'Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now I need you most

God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
And keep my head above water
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
Above water

And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe

God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

So God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown

Don't let me drown

I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin'
Wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow

Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying

She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show

Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying

She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor

Singing ying-ying, ying-ying

In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
'Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a—
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: don't coax me
It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be—
Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, 'cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking
And you, too, you can—

Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me

Permanently; you're just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see

There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Inglés
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin', unless

And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see

And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself

We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold me—just like you told me

When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth

And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?

You've never seen nothing like it
No, never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive

Let me tell you all about it
And the world will so allow it
Ooh, give me a little time to choose

Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night

Here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
Fie-fo the black queen, marching single file

Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
March to the black queen

Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
A little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
Black on, black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun

Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise
March to the black queen

Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby
You can be my honey chile, yes

A voice from behind me reminds me
""Spread out your wings. You are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy.""

In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even 'til the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black queen

My life is in your hands
I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be your bad boy 
I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the black queen

Walking to the style
She's vulgar 'buse and vile
Fie-fo the black queen tattoos all her pies
She boils, and she bakes, and she never dots her Is
She's our leader

Forget your sing-alongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil, beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone forever

She used to tell me he hated me

But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!

These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit 'cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'mma pull you to this bullet, and put it through you

Shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, OK Ma?
""Oh, now he's raping his own mother,
Abusing a whore, snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""

You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin, vrinn vrinn, vrinnn!

Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on

For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me – I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too! You ain't nothing but a girl to me

'Cause Shady will fucking kill you
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)

Like a murder weapon, I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em

I ain't ""acid rap"", but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the 10th

But that's normal ain't it Norman?

'Cause ladies' screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece!

Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?

Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school

I don't even believe in breathing
I'm leaving air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
OK, I'm ready to go play
I got the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache

You faggots keep egging me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet

That doesn't come from somewhere deep inside us
Depraved souls
Trusting in the one thing
The one thing that this life has not denied us

When I feel the warmth
Of your very soul
I forget I'm cold
And crying
When your lips touch mine
And I lose control
I forget I'm old
And dying

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need

Since the day I've been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need
Just a little bit baby
That's all I need, that's all I need

So don't send no doctor to my door
'Cause Doctor John been here before
Don't you send him, just come yourself
Bring your loving and nothing else

Ooh just a, just a, 
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day

Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Father please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life…
The war that never ends

When was the last time you kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
Even longer since I felt like your man

So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends

Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in

You never look at me and say, ""I love you""
How much more do you think I can stand?
Oh, and there's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord, she's happy just holding my hand

So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends

We may whisper once more

I think that you should let it burn

And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all

[Ed:]
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
""'Cause real will recognise real"" is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

[Devlin:]
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Chorus:]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

[Ed:]
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.

[Devlin:]
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

[Chorus:]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4]
The times I'm living in lately.

Well there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding across the desert and starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The town's people wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

Well the Marshall now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death

Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

Well we drove that car all night 'til we got into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off

Well we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love. Well we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us
Come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said ""Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while""

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming
A ride back to where she started
But she changed the subject every time money came up
She said ""Welcome to the land of the living dead"". You could tell she was
So broken-hearted
She said ""Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt""

""How far are you all going ?"" Ruby asked us with a sigh
""We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn
Until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies""
Ruby just smiled and said. ""Ah you know some babies never learn""

Something about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking my way

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love

Well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing the street when shots rang out
I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran
We got him cornered in the churchyard? I heard somebody shout

Well you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said
""A man with no alibi""
You went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do

Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes
You just find yourself over the line
Oh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now
You know I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how
Well I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah but you know it's not the one that I had in mind
He's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about
But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love

You know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name
Wasn't Henry Porter
And you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too
Good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind
In the French Quarter

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who
Are most content
I don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone
You always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most
Convenient then they repent
And I always said. ""Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on""

There was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot
In the back
Seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love

1039,Avicii,,The Days,,"

Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

Heart ache, heart break
All over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door

And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

Time flew, cut through
All over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store

You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget!

And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

2892,Bob Dylan,2012.0,Tin Angel,"""Tempest""","

It was late last night when the boss came home
To wander early his mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said boss the ladies gone
She left this morning just before dawn

You got something to tell me, tell it to me man
Come to the point as straight as you can
Old henry lee chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand

The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by put up a prayer

Well they rode all night and they rode all day
Eastward long on the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went

He came to a place where the land was dull
His poor head pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

Well he threw down his helmet and his cross handle sword
He renounced his faith he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

He leaned down cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two
Hard to tell for certain who was who

He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quickening every vein
His knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit inseparably linked
Got a strange premonition there's a man close by
Don't worry about him he wouldn't harm a fly

From behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

She turned she was startled by a look of surprise
With the hatred that could hit the skies
You're a reckless fool I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise

Get up stand up you greedy lipped wench
And cover your face with some other consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes on double quick

Sill boy you think me a saint
To listen no more to your words of complaint
You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes

Id have given you the stars and the planets too
What good are these things to you
By the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you see

Oh please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold
Oh my dear you must be blind
He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind

You've had your way too long with me
Now its me who will determine how things will be
Tried to escape he cussed and cursed
You'll have to try get passed me first

I dared not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you sir you can not deny
You made a monkey of me for what and for why

Ill have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you I'll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you'll wish you died

The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
The first bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted bin

He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He grabbed the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth he's as good as dead

You shot my husband down you fiend
Husband what, husband what the hell do you mean
He was man of strife a man of sin
I cut him down and I throw him to the wind

Hear this she said with angry breath
You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life
And she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
You're a murderous woman and bloody wife
If you don't mind ill have the knife

We're two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we're no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men is all I knew
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His doom was sealed he slipped to the floor
He whispered in her ear this is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt

She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
You die for me I will die for you
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it though

All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

And he'll be better to you than I used to be

Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it anymore

Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind

[Barbra:]
This is me talking to you
Tell me what your heart can do ?
Take me by surprise, whatever you see
You'll never be alone with me

I close or open the door
Telling you that less is more
You cannot disguise whatever you do
No one is above the law

In these dark and troubled times
People just surviving
We live a double life

You'd be safe and warm at home
Something else is going on
We don't have to kiss and say no more about it
And if your eyes are watching me

[Both:]
Baby, life could be so beautiful
And we become invisible
The pleasure is the punishment
For the crime

[Barbra:]
Break away the chains that bind
It's not enough to be satisfied
It's knowing how it all begins
Or knowing where the heart belongs
And we all make mistakes

[Both:]
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
And our love
Is love above the law

[Barry:]
So you decide we go insane
I know what you came here for
Whether you are mine
I'll never be sure
We'll ever be above the law
On this dark and stormy night

[Barbra:]
(Hmm hmm...)

[Barry:]
Where these walls may hide us

[Barbra:]
(The walls may hide us...)

[Barry:]
You sigh and let me in
You let me hold you in these arms of mine

[Barbra:]
(One flame inside)

[Barry:]
Tomorrow is eternity

[Barbra:]
(Temptation eyes)

[Barry:]
And we may get to kiss and say no more about it

[Barbra:]
(No tears to cry)

[Barry:]
And if my eyes are watching you

[Both:]
Baby, life could be so beautiful ([Barry:] So beautiful)
And everything is possible ([Barbra:] Everything is possible)
And we become invisible ([Barbra:] We become invisible )

It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
I'll always be with you
It's what I'm living for

The end of my rainbow
Is outside your window
And our love is one love
Love above the law ([Barbra:] Love above the law )
It's your heart and my heart
And no one can take part
I'll always be with you
It's what I'm living for ([Barbra:] It's what I'm living for )

The end of my rainbow
Is outside your window
And our love is one love

This is me talking to you
Tell me what your heart can do?

They say distance is relative
And relative to relatives I have
I'd say I'm relatively close
To breaking down
Because right now
I feel so alone
I've been missing the elements and
Wishing the elephant in the room
Would leave and kindly close the door
I can't ignore
Him like before
Not anymore

Oh, I miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it all feels to me
So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it feels at six feet

Space and time are interwoven
Or at least that's what we're told
When I was young I was suspicious but it's true
Time sticks like glue
I feel so blue
Here missing you
So I think I'll build a time machine and go back to a time
When we didn't need to measure six feet on the ground
And I came around
That's not allowed
Can't go back now

So I miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it all feels to me
So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it feels at six feet

Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave without leaving a piece of youth

And our lives are forever changed
You can never be the same
The more you change the less you feel

Believe, believe in me, believe, believe
That life can change, that you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same, we're different

Tonight
Tonight, tonight, it's so bright
Tonight,
Ohh tonight

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light

And the embers never fade in your city by the lake
The place where Jon Walker was born

So believe, believe in me, believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now

Cause I believe there's not a chance tonight
Tonight, tonight, it's so bright
Tonight
Oh tonight

We'll crucify the insincere tonight
We'll make it right, we'll feel it all tonight
If you believe we'll offer up the night tonight
The indescribable moments of your life tonight
The impossible is possible tonight
So believe in me because I believe in you, tonight,

To escape this old world, this old world

Some days I lie wide awake 'til the Sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascending these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world

And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

Or anyone, below the Sun
And I don't feel anything

We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (things different)
'Cause it was such a dumb-ass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got… thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda led to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin' still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, back-stabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

Can you keep a secret?

Come on

These walls keep a secret
That only we know
But how long can they keep it?
'Cause we're two lovers
We lose control

We're two shadows

Chasing rainbows

That you'll always be the one for me

Two people making memories
Just too good to tell
And these arms are never empty
When we're lying where we fell

We're painting pictures

Making magic

Taking chances

They would see the love in sight
They would see
Me
In your arms in ecstasy
And with every move they'd know I love you so

I love you so

When I'm feeling weak
You give me wings
When the fire has no heat
You light it up again
When I hear no violins
You play my every string
Stop the press
Hold the news
The secret's safe between me and you
Walls, can you keep a secret?

If walls could talk, ooh
They would say I want you more
They would say, hey
Never felt like this before?
And that you'll always be the one for me

What's left to say?
These prayers ain't working anymore
Every word shot down in flames
What's left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?
I'm losing my voice calling on you

'Cause I've been shaking
I've been bending backwards till I'm broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke

Let beauty come out of ashes
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God all I ask is
Can beauty come out of ashes?

Can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?
'Cause I need you here, woah

'Cause I've been shaking
I've been bending backwards till I'm broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke

I want someone to come home to
I need somewhere I can sleep
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones
And have a conversation not too deep

Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is
They've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains
Someone letting them be

I want someone who can save me
When I come home from the zoo
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator
I can give my alligator to

Everybody seem to know what they are talking about
And I can see why it is
They got someone breaking them out
Someone finding a key
Someone setting them free

Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Would you dare to find my key?

I want someone who can bail me
When I get up to my tricks
I need somebody used to dealing with a sinner
Whenever I get in I fix

Everybody else busy doing better than me

Someone breaking the chains
Someone letting them be

[Verse 1]
I'm here at the crossroad 
Where my life is heading? Man, I don't know 
Should I stay or should I go? 
Coz anything's better than what I've been through 
What I would give to get a sign from up above? 
Letting me know that everything would be OK 
I wish someone would pull me off from out of the mud 
Will anyone out there say to me 

[Chorus:]
I'm here, for you 
Don't worry coz I got you (I got you baby) 
Don't trip (don't trip) 
Don't stress (don't stress) 
My life seems to be hell 
Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 

[Verse 2]
Now everyday that goes by 
I see things that'll make another man cry 
I'm sitting wondering why 
I can't find that someone to fit in my life 
see I was searching, but am I worth it? 
And did they ever think I'm good enough for them? 
Despite my suffering I felt the loving (felt the loving) 
The blessing came when I needed it the most 

And that's the sign that I received from up above 
Letting me know that everything would be OK 
And that was that something that pulled me out of the mud 
And also was the one that said to me 

[Chorus:]
I'm here, for you 
Don't worry coz I got you (I got you baby) 
Don't trip (don't trip) 
Don't stress (don't stress) 
My life seems to be hell 
Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 

No matter, no matter how far you fall down 
You gotta, you gotta be ready to stand up 
I've been through the same things you going through now (Been through the same things) 
But you gotta believe in you 

No matter, no matter how far you fall down 
You gotta, you gotta be ready to stand up (Gotta be ready) 
I've been through the same things you going through now (Stand up) 
But you gotta believe in you (Coz I got you)

Over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge 
Feels like I'm heading over the edge

Lemme tell a little story, about this dude I knew, he said 
Used to go to school out in L.I.U., he said
He'd make me a bet, he'd own his own jet, and he'd
Show me the city, from a bird's eye view, said he
Came from Jamaica, he had a little paper
He owned a couple acres, and then I caught the vapors
That's how we got together, on the bike
Late night, Kawasaki leathers (Ah huh!) He used to
Wine and dine me, dom and sex and we be
Arm and armor, 'Mani dress and see I ain't need
A leprechaun, or four leaf clover, I just
Woke up one morning, and he copped the Rover, see?
I knew about them girls, he had back then, but
I was getting money, I ain't care 'bout them, 'cause
They was getting Gs, I had Ms, I used to
Split my dividends, with all my friends, 'cause
I was in the lounge, they was in the Greyhound, like
In and out of town, moving coke by the pound, like
Guess it didn't sound right, 'cause them bitches was mad 
Started plotting, trying to get what I had, see 
My homegirl Teisha, said that Keisha with the 
Real black lips, used to smoke that reefer, some 
Bitch, named Dawn, used to fuck LaiQwan and
Alicia with the chinky eyes, used to be with freaky Ty
Lived across the street, from this nigga named Tiki Diamond
Yeah, chicken noodle bitches, like a pack of Ramen
They had it out for me, kidnapped my brother
At the rucker, 'cause he used to put it down for me

Oh my God, they caught Brandon, I got his picture in the mail
He was rocking a Vanson, the note said
""Bitch, we got surveillance on the mansion and we gonna need thirty million for the ransom""

Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect tonight

Darling, you look perfect tonight

There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true?

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away all the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?

We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly

Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
And while I can think,
While I can talk
While I can stand,
While I can walk
While I can dream,
Please let my dream come true... right now
Let it come true right now

And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night

Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are

But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

No, my enemy is a friend of mine in a friendly place to be seen
Hey, you know I'll run away for a couple years just to prove I’ve never been free

They will never find me here [x4]

Yeah

Ima make a deal with the bad wolf so the bad wolf don’t bite no more [x8]

They call your daddy Big Boots
And Big Boots is his name
It takes a big man to wear big boots
That's your daddy's claim to fame
They know your daddy Big Boots
Wherever soldiers are
'Cause he can handle an armored tank
Just like a kiddy can
So sleep little soldier
Don't you cry
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
General sandman's soon coming by
Loo loo loo loo
Loo loo loo
I'm gonna tell you a little secret
You won't believe it's true
Did you know your

Once wore little boots like you

It was 6:48, I was walking home
Stepped through the gate, and I'm all alone
I had chicken on the plate, but the food was cold
Then I covered up my face so that no one knows
I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble
When my mom walked into the living room
She said, ""Boy, you gotta tell me what they did to you""
I said, ""You don't wanna know the things I had to do""
She said, ""Son, you gotta tell me why you're black and blue""
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble

And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, air was freezing
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight

Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer

Well I squared him up, left my chest exposed
He threw a quick left hook and it broke my nose
I had thick red blood running down my clothes
And a sick, sick look 'cause I like it though
I said I didn't want trouble, I'm the boy in the bubble
But then came trouble

And my heart was pumping, chest was screaming
Mind was running, nose was bleeding
Put my hands up, put my hands up
I told this kid I'm ready for a fight

Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer

It was 6:48, he was walking home
With the blood on his hands from my broken nose
But like every other day, he was scared to go
Back to his house 'cause his pops was home
Drowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles
Just looking for trouble
Well, there's no excuse for the things he did
But there's a lot at home that he's dealing with
Because his dad's been drunk since he was a kid
And I hope one day that he'll say to him
Put down those bubbles and that belt buckle
In this broken bubble

Punch my face, do it 'cause I like the pain
Every time you curse my name
I know you want the satisfaction, it's not gonna happen
Knock me out, kick me when I'm on the ground
It's only gonna let you down
Come the lightning and the thunder
You're the one who'll suffer, suffer

Oh listen sister,
I love my mister man,
And I can't tell you why
There is no reason why I should love that man,
It must be somethin' that de angels have planned.
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,
I gotta love one man till I die.
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know.
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
When he goes away, that's a rainy day,
And when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He can come home as late as can be,
Home without him ain't no home to me,
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.

5956,Michael Jackson,,Ready 2 Win,,"

It's time you put away your fear
And it's time try to dream a little big
It's time to give your dreams another chance
And it's time to take away the will in hand

To the flames that's burning strong
To the rain that's coming on
I'll be holding on to memories
I can make it on my own

I believe I'm ready to win
I know I'm ready to soar
If you pick me up when I down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win

They say it's a miracle today (Oh my)
You are never going far today (Hold on)
Life is your chance (Oh no)
You got your chance
Go get your win
It feels like I can fly with broken wings

Now the wind is blowing strong
I can do it on my own
I can do it all alone now
And I'm never turning back again

I believe I'm ready to win (Oh, my friend)
I know I'm ready to soar
If you pick me up when I am down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win

They say I'm dreaming life away
(They say I'm throwing it all away)
And I can't get back my yesterday (Dream again)
So I say I never saw love without you

I believe I'm ready to win (I believe in miracles)
I know I'm ready to soar (Oh my friend)
If you pick me up when I am down
Turn it all around
Cause I know I'm ready to win

Call my name!
(I know I'm ready to win)
And I know I'm ready to win
You and me, baby
I believe it, baby

You’re graceful, your grace falls down around me in my eyes
You’re lovely, your love leaves
So he’s only in my eyes

Another day left waiting alone in my room
With no calls from you
So I call you up but you let me down
Falling down around everyone except yourself

I thought that this would never end
Things were so clear but they fell through
I hopes of problems never felt, thinking of the best

You’re graceful, your grace falls down around me in my eyes
You’re lovely, your love leaves
So he’s only in my eyes, in my eyes

Another day left crying
With you in my room with nothing left to do
You say that its alright
You say its over now
Sit still, annoyed, with no one around

I thought that this would never end
Things were so clear but they fell through
I hopes of problems never felt, thinking of the best

You’re graceful, your grace falls down around me in my eyes
You’re lovely, your love leaves
So he’s only in my eyes

The  summer  knows
And unashamed
She sheds her clothes
The  summer  smoothes
The  restless  sky
And  lovingly
She  warms  the  sand
On  which  you  lie
The  summer knows
The summer's wise
She sees the doubts
Within your  eyes
And so she takes
Her  Summertime
Tells  the moon  to  wait
And  the  sun  to linger
Twist the world
Round  her summer  finger
Lets  you  see
The  wonder of  it  all
And  if  you've learned
Your lesson  well
There's little more
For her to tell
One last caress

For fall...

How the fuck he got an Oscar?
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of k-mart plaza
Across from the red lobster
Looking like the Lochness monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap it costs less to gossip
I’d probably be a lot less
Hostile if you snots kept your shnozzes out the airholes
Or get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy, yeah both ears and hah! yes nostrils
At the ozzfest with nas bumping das efx in wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson vicodin out my pocket
They cost less I'm a hot mess cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasp’s nest in the process awesome

Drunk as fuck
One sock pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking hydroxycuts and four oxy's stuck in my esophagus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screamin' ""Serves you right you cocky fuck!
That's what you get for mockin' us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was.""
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
And it's a sock puppet so no strings attached you can all suck it

Well my mama laid me down
My mama laid me down

Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place
This godforsaken place

[Chorus:]
Only Mama knows
What she laid me down
In this godforsaken town
She was running too
What she was running from
I always wondered
I never knew
Only Mama knows
Only Mama knows

I'm passing through
I'm on my way
On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through
No fixed abode
And that is why....
I need to try
To hold on
I've got to hold on [3x]

Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she live in disgrace
Well, I never
Will I ever
See my father's face
See my father's face

[Chorus 2x]

Gotta hold on... [4x]

I met her on the way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(She's loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone
(She's wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
59 was the code she gave
(She's loving me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
But she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

I never would've thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels

It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(She's loving me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone
(She's wanting me)
She said just to give her a page
59 was the code she gave
(She's loving me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
But she was loving me, loving me
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife
(She's wanting me)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(She's loving me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(She's wanting me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah

Why... Ooh no
Alright
Ohh
(I'm in love, love)

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holding her to blame

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(Holding her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn't have no phone
(Holding her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
59 was the code she gave
(Holding her to blame)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
But she was loving me, loving me
(Holding her to blame)
Yeah

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife

Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldn't you?

That I'm immune to gloom, that I'm hard through and through

With one more look at you
I could learn to tame the clouds and let the sun shine through
Leave a troubled past and I might start anew
I'll solve the mysteries if you're the prize
Refresh these tired eyes
With one more look or you I might overcome the anger
That I've learned to know
Find a peace of mind I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again
And I belong again
For when you look or me,
I'm everything and more that I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise
I won't be alone
We'll love and live more, love and live forever
With one more look at you
I'd learn to change the stars
And change our fortunes too
I'd have the constellations point your portrait too
So all the world might share this wondrous sight
The world could end each night
With one more look at you
With one more look at you
I want one more look at you
Are you watching me now?
Watch closely now
Your eyes ore like fingers
Touching my body
Arousing me so
I'm riding the passion arising inside me
How high can I go?
You're comin' with me: I'm gonna show you how
And when it's scary, I won't look down
Are you watching me now?
Watch closely now
I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me on
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther
Than I've ever gone
Your pleasure is part of the secret
Of flight that I found
When I feel like on eagle
My soul has no place on the ground
Born out of madness
I'll double the danger with no net at all,
If you don't look away I'm secure
In the fact that you won't let me fall
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now
I'm the master magician
Who'll help you escape
From the lies you've been hold
When they're breaking your back
Bring the last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
I break chains made of boredom
That others have lived with for years
I leave good news on doorsteps
And laughs where there used to be tears
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
But I can take it
I won't look down
Watch closely now
Are you watching me now
Watch me now
Are you watching me now
Are you watching me now

When I said, I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away

Don't you know that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own
Then I have to follow you
And beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me,
I'll never tie you down

Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

She dances in his sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep

She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

Dinner is served by nine

Yet she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door

She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Cause she's a slave to the rhythm

This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask

[Long and movie versions only:]
Live and learn
Well the years they flew
And we never knew
We were foolish then
We would never tire
And that little fire
Is still alive in me
It will never go away
Can't say goodbye to yesterday (can't say goodbye)

No regrets
But I wish that you
Were here with me
Well then there's hope yet
I can see your face
In our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream)
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy

The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me

Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will
make each night the first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time... we've learned to sail above
Time... won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen...

The world you're coming into,
Is no easy place to enter.
Every day is haunted
By the echoes of the past.
Funny thoughts and wild; wild dreams
Will find their way into your mind.

The clouds that hang above us,
May be full of rain and thunder.
But in time they slide away
To find the sun still there.
Lazy days and wild. wild flowers
Will bring some joy into your heart.
And I will always love you,
I'll welcome you into this world.

[MARY DEE and BOY SOLO]
You-re mine and I will love you.

[SHANTY]
Where-s my dinner?
I've been working hard all day
And a man can work up quite an appetite that way.

What's for dinner?
Something nourishing and hot?
I could tackle quite a lot of 'you know what'
And all I've got to say to you is 'Why no dinner?'

I've got nothing on my plate.
It's expected of a mate.
Why'd 'ya have to make me wait?
Where's my...

[MARY DEE]
This is the way we put out the candle.
Farewell to childhood.
Deep in the wild wood a fire goes out,
And what are we left with
Now we are grown up?

[SHANTY]
This is the way we pull up the anchor.
Goodbye to romance.
Out on the ocean a good ship is lost,
And what are we left with
Now we are grown Up?

[MARY DEE]
Time to be thinking of real life feelings.
I must get on.

[SHANTY]
Time to be buying those little trinkets
I can't afford.
Lord knows
I want to give her the best.
But where will
I find the rest of the cash?

[MARY DEE]
It's one mad dash
To fame and fortune.
The cymbals clash
And then you're gone.

[SHANTY]
So what are my chances
Of getting promotion?
The way things are going
It doesn't look good.

What good is complaining,
It's getting you nowhere.
And I'm in the middle of your whirlwind
In the eye of your storm.

Spare me your excuses.

No excuses.

Pardon my anger.

I'm not a slave.
I work for a living,
I can command the respect of my peers.
Where did you go?
You were out with the boys.

[SHANTY]
So what if I went for a drink?
You'd think to listen to you
It was some sort of crime.

But all I could find was myself.
If you were the same man I married,
You'd know that your woman needs love.

And what about me?
I suppose I don't matter.
I'm not even sure
If you ever loved me.

Right!
That's it!

As you lie there sleeping?
Take the time to rest your troubled head.
I will watch over you till the moment you awake.

Can you hear what I say
As you lie there sleeping?
When misfortunes crowd into your day
And the dark side of life
Has become too much to bear,
I will stay by your side.
Though we don't yet know if there's something wrong
You were brought in from the street
And a witness said you gave a shout
As you fell down at his feet.

We are running tests
And soon the results will be known.
But I feel I have to warn you,
There may be complications.

But we don't yet know if your child is in danger.
We shall have to wait and see.
In the meantime
There is nothing more for you to do
But sleep.

Most welcome.
Soon one of us.

[MARY DEE]
No, I tell you!
You'll never get through,
I'll never let you.
No-one is stealing this child.
I'm not afraid of Ghosts that the past left behind.

[SHANTY]
Let her recover,
Then let me love her
Until we run out of time.
And in the future
I will promise to be the man
She had in mind.

[NURSE]
Be still.
Be calm.
Your child is safe.

[MARY DEE]
Do we live in a world
With an uncertain future
Where a man is unsure of his fate?
Will we come to our senses
Be fair to each other?
Can we turn it around
Before it's too late?

Do I know that we have the answer?
Yes, I know now We are together.

So we must bear in mind
That the pages are turning
And the sand will run out of the glass.
In the heat of the battle
We will drive out the demons
And we'll carry the day,

The voices in your head

One touch is all it took
To draw you in
To leave you hooked
One kiss, you paid the price
You had a taste
Of paradise

Now you're running in circles
Chasing imaginary footsteps
Reaching for shadows
In the bed where I once slept

You lose control
You make mistakes
This pain will never leave
Until I die
You'll always grieve

Seeing my face wherever you go
Talking to strangers
From a place they'll never know

Is where your space is

Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty

And the emptiness is too much to bear

Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed ""Fuck the world""
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful

The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested

Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

Oh oh

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer - you're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You’re not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I’m searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you

Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

Don’t drop me in
It’s not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
I miss you

Shady, we're back

Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
You better just make new living arrangements
If you think you're the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is, I'm best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name no, ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z
Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe they'll name me
Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ
Or say ""he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
Yo, his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad-I-o
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily""
And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big-big-big-big-b-baby

So maybe the 80s made me crazy, I been tryna get my weight
Up since the Ace Slim Shady gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day, replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the a fey at 18, 8 years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream so

Shady (Stat Quo!), we're back

This is what I eat, sleep, and breath and feed my kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block, fought with my rocks and squeeze
Critics expecting me to under achieve
I just deal with the hate I receive by rollin' back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze I bring him right to his knees?
And tell him suck my dick, take a bow and leave with a sack full of unmarked cheese, I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed to be Gs and claim they runnin' shit, nigga I run me, I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me, that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be asking where I be, dawg I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it drink my pee
Record song for the Detox LP, feet don't fail he, niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Bellvee?
I'm 'a die wealthy, boss in the game, what the fuck they goin' tell me, A-Town's entrée, Aftermath Shady

Shady (Bobby Creek!), we're back

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
(None of them) stand a chance, at the dance without a bowtie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga, I'm just living me
We the reason for the season
So I'm breezing through the track, nigga

Shady

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected getting weight from MS 13
With S.K.'s, A.R.'s and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, Ds and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

Shady, we're back
Ha, I told you we was back
What
Ha ha ha

Where goes a woman with a warm embrace?
Does a man walk in the hard rain?

You're coming up, and they're standing next in line
Give it a line and dive, run close

Mmm. . .
One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy
But all I do is cry, cry
No more laughter
(Oh I should be happy)
Oh why did he go
I only know that since he left
My life's so empty
Though I try to forget
It just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings
I still run
I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
(I should be happy)
'Cause I still love him so
I end each day the way I started
Crying my heart out
(Start and end each day crying)
One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man
(One less man)
To pick up after
No more laughter, no more laughter
Since he went away
(Since he went away)
Since he went away
Mmm... a chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there' s no one there
To hold you tight and no one there
You can kiss goodnight
A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing ever gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
And when it ends, it ends in tears
So darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
Oh, I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh please, be there still in love with me
One less bell to answer
Each time the doorbell rings I still run
One less egg to fry

To pick up after

No more laughter

It's unbelievable it's strange but true
It's inconceivable it could happen to you
You're going north and you're going south
Just like bait in a fish's mouth
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star
It's unbelievable it would get this far.

It's unbelievable what they'd have you to think
It's indescribable it can drive you to drink
They said it was the land of milk and honey
Now they say it's the land of money
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick
It's unbelievable you could get this rich this quick.

Every head is so dignified
Every mood is so sanctified
Every urge is so satisfied
As long as you have paid
All the silver all the gold
All the sweethearts that you can hold
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.

It's unbelievable like a lead balloon
So impossible to even line the tomb
Kill that beast and feet that swine
Scale that wall and smoke that wine
Beat that horse and saddle up that drum
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.

Once there was a man who had no eyes
Every lady in the land told him lies
He stood beneath the silver skies
And his heart beat could plead
Every brain is civilized
Every nerve is analyzed
Everything is critized when you are in need.

It's unbelievable it's fancy-free
So interchangeable so delightful to see
Turn you back wash you hands
There's always someone who understands
It don't matter no more what you got to say
It's unbelievable it go down this way.

I got this knot inside my throat, call my vodka up if I come
And I'm not suicidal, I just drink to forget my problems
Seems like the kids these days are all just lookin' to get higher, oh
I'm just the same, anything's I won't tell momma and father

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothin' wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

I got my woman, got my high, my guitar, and some money
And I'll be goddamned if these fuckers try to take that from me
But ain't shit wrong with us and don't tell me, ""Talk to somebody""
I'm drunk at 2 p.m., treat every day like it's a Friday

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

Not much to do these days, we sit and smoke my life away
Just like everyone else I know (Uh)
Not much to do these days, I got too much on the way
Sit back and light up and let go

You know, you know, just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone

I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling so brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm sure of falling

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt devil, almost fall apart then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is seizing us

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you

[Yentl's friend and study partner, Avigdor,
takes her with him to dinner at the home of
his beautiful bride-to-be, Hadass.]

No wonder he loves her,
No wonder at all.
The moment she sees him,
Her thought is to please him.
Before he even knows that he's hunger
She's already there with his plate.
Before his glass is even empty
She's filling it up God forbid he should wait!
Before he has the chance to tell her
He's chilly, she'll go put a log on the fire
Fulfilling his every desire-
No trouble...No bother.
No wonder she's pretty,
What else should she be
She hasn't a worry,
And why should she worry
When she gets up her biggest decision
Is figuring out what to wear.
To pick a blouse, a skirt,
And then there's the problem of what
Should she do with her hair.
And later as she stands and studies
A chicken,  the question's ""to roast
Or to not roast""
Or better yet may be a pot roast?
Tomatoes? No... Potatoes?
No wonder he likes it-
It's perfect this way
Who wouldn't want someone
Who fusses and flatters?
Who makes you feel that you're all that matters?
Whose only aim in life is to serve you
And make you think she doesn't deserve you?
No wonder he loves her-
What else could he do?
If I were a man, I would too!

Running 'til I crashed into you

I was a train wreck, but you took the ride

Nothing else that I wanna do

I breathe in hard
Don't speak, 'cause it's like a bitter pill
You blow my mind, you make my heart beat
The king's a clown
No one is loving, it's not a drill
Don't look outside, the world is ending
(Faster, faster, faster, faster, fast)

The echoes of that news ring loud (The echoes, the echoes)
No sound can ever drown it out (The echoes)

It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into a million pieces, oh

If it's gonna break me, won't you let me go?
Leave it 'til the morning, I don't wanna know

We're too far gone
Nothing I say will mean anything
Just drink, dance right through disaster
I don't wanna talk about it now

McKinley hollered, McKinley squalled
Doctor said, ""McKinley, death is on the wall
‪Say it to me, if you got something to confess""
‪I heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬
‪I heard it on the wireless radio ‬
‪From down in the boondocks way down in Key West
‪I'm searching for love, for inspiration ‬
‪On that pirate radio station
‪Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest ‬
‪Radio signal, clear as can be
‪I'm so deep in love that I can hardly see ‬
‪Down on the flatlands, way down in Key West

‪Key West is the place to be ‬
‪If you're looking for immortality ‬
‪Stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬
‪Key West is fine and fair
‪If you lost your mind, you will find it there
‪Key West is on the horizon line

‪I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
‪Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac
‪Like Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest ‬
‪Well, it might not be the thing to do ‬
‪But I'm sticking with you through and through ‬
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West
‪I got both my feet planted square on the ground ‬
‪Got my right hand high with the thumb down ‬
‪Such is life, such is happiness
‪Hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
‪If you wear one, put it behind your ear
‪Down in the bottom, way down in Key West ‬

‪Key West is the place to go
‪Down by the Gulf of Mexico ‬
‪Beyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand
‪Key West is the gateway key ‬
‪To innocence and purity ‬
‪Key West, Key West is the enchanted land

‪I've never lived in the land of Oz ‬
‪Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬
‪It's hot down here, and you can't be overdressed
‪Tiny blossoms of a toxic plant ‬
‪They can make you dizzy, I'd like to help you but I can't
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West ‬
‪Well, the Fishtail Palms, and the orchid trees
‪They can give you that bleeding heart disease
‪People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness ‬
‪On Newton Street, Bayview Park ‬
‪Walking in the shadows after dark ‬
‪Down under, way down in Key West ‬
‪I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
‪I know all the Hindu rituals ‬
‪People tell me that I'm truly blessed ‬
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West

Key West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
You stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
Feel the sunlight on your skin, and the healing virtues of the wind
Key West, Key West is the land of light

Wherever I travel, wherever I roam
I'm not that far from the convent home
I do what I think is right, what I think is best
Mystery Street off of Mallory Square
Truman had his White House there
East bound, West bound, way down in Key West
Twelve years old, they put me in a suit
Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That's my story, but not where it ends
She's still cute, and we're still friends
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
I play both sides against the middle
Trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news, I heard your last request
Fly around, my pretty little Miss
I don't love nobody, give me a kiss
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West

Key West is the place to be
If you're looking for immortality
Key West is paradise divine
Key West is fine and fair
If you lost your mind, you'll find it there
Key West is on the horizon line

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

2984,Bob Dylan,,Help Me Understand,,"

Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand

Friends, I'd like to tell a story of a family I once knew
We'll call them William and Mary and their little daughter Sue
Now Mary was just the average housewife
And Bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family arguments
But neither one ever got mad
Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word lead to another
And the last word lead to divorce
Now here's two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthen their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense
You know she didn't ask to be brought to this world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones that its hurting the most
There'd be a lot more honest lovin'
In this cruel world today
If just a few hundred parents
Could hear little Sue say
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand

Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Heavenly father, help me understand

You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon

to all the nights that we forgot to get back home.

Drink up last call before the sunrise sets the scene,
of empty bottles, heavy hearts,
the memories of broken dreams...
We were so tired yet so alive,
wrapped up in lies like sheets of another one night stand,

Sunrise through the window pane, where tired eyes will close....
Stay seventeen, the party scene has got the best of me and you,

I know she hopes I choke on this last drink,
drop dead before my influence gets to her head...
She said, ""I'll love you forever, or find something better.
It's all just the same as when we sleep together.
We wake up with headaches, and trouble remembering
what went wrong...""

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, haha

I watched with glee as your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
So let me, please, introduce myself
I'm the man of the wealth and taste (Oh yeah)
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Just as every cop's a criminal
And all the sinners' saints
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politics
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down

Mixin' vodka with the champagne
Tell me how much liquor can a man take
How many records have I sold?

You know that I've been on a roll
Celebratin' life when I come around (come around)
Sippin' all night, sippin' all day

You dressed yet?
Dressed, why?
We've got cocktails at the Cosden's. We said we'd drop by
Do we have to?
Then, there's dinner at the Dodges', the reception at the Rose's
I think I'm gonna die.
So how about we just stay home?
Could we do that? I like your thinking

You are the best thing that ever has happened to me,
You are.
Okay then, one of the best things that's happened to me.
You are.
You think I'd find someone.
Who could surprise me.
And size me up without cutting me down.
Ain't this a town? (Sure it is)

You are the god-damnd'est thing that has happened to me...
Ever (Sorry)
When did I have this much happiness happen to me?
Never.
I can't believe my luck.
And all I can do
Is be the best thing that's happened to you.

So what do you say we just stay home?
What do you say we just go out on the boat and get smashed
And make love on the beach and stare up at the moon?

You might just be the best thing that has happened to me,
Well, so far (So far?)
Of course, not much very good's ever happened to me,
So far (Me too)
I never much liked love.
I always fought it.
I never thought it would happen like this...
Give us a kiss.

We might just be the best thing that has happened to us,
Kiddo (Sugar)
Another moment like this may not happen to us,
Partner (Lover)
When all is said and done,
You happen to be,
The best thing that ever has happened 
The luckiest thing that has happened
You are the best thing that's happened to me
Who knew?
Who dreamed?
Beats me.

So don't get dressed.
I was hoping you'd say that.

Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago.
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect. You know?

The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young.
The sun was always shining. We just lived for fun.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know.
The rest of my life's been just a show.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you.

You can't turn back the clock,
You can't turn back the tide.
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride
When life was just a game.

No use sitting and thinking on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids.

Sometimes it seems like lately.
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

'Cause these are the days of our lives.
They've flown in the swiftness of time.
These days are all gone now,
But some things remain
When I look and I find no change.

Those were the days of our lives.
The bad things in life were so few.
Those days are all gone now,
But one thing's still true
When I look and I find I still love you.

I still love you.

Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe

'Cause when it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
(Seeing is believin')
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true

Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throw over mind

[Chorus x2]

Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (Yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (Sneeze)
Last time, I broke her collar bone, she's intolerable (Yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phenomenal, though
We're an unlikely pair (Yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (Yeah)
People don't like us together, but like we care (Not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (Yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals
For her with both of my feet bare (Yeah)
But soon as I ask to hit (Ask to hit)
It's like she grabs a switch (Grabs a switch)
And turns me over her knee
'Cause my ass is whipped, yeah
And I got her back, but I'm spineless (Yeah)
So when she stabs me in mine (Yeah)
It's like I just can't feel the knife (What?)
As she pokes, jabs it, and slices
One minute, she'll build me up (Up)
The next, she'll push me 'round
Probably why she calls me ""dumbbell""
She lifts me up (Yeah), then puts me down (Huh)

But if this is actually happenin', ""sucker for pain""
I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
But her by her motherfuckin' hair's
All I ""imagine draggin'"" (Dragon)
She lunges, attacks, and scratches
But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
Like Kaep for the National Anthem
As I stab, I'm laughin'
So much for witchcraft and magic
Abracadabra that, bitch
No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
I give her one last hug goodbye
Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
But in hindsight
Think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
As I pop another five Vic's
That's what this high's like
Look down, there's mud on my Nikes
Shovel at my side, blood on my mic

Return to sender
Return to sender

I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright in early next morning
He brought my letter back

She wrote upon it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone

We had a quarrel, a lovers' spat
I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back

So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright in early next morning
It came right back to me

She wrote upon it
Return to sender, address unknown
No such person, no such zone

This time I'm gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day
Then I'll understand the writing on it

Return to sender, address unknown
No such number, no such zone

Return to sender

2669,Bob Dylan,1974.0,Something There Is About You,"""Planet Waves""","

Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Something that's crossed over from another century ?

Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long forgotten truth.

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things
I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now I am in some better place
My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up on the baton
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.

How the web was woven
Can't get loose, can't let go
Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart
I'm no longer free
At last I'm where you want me
Don't you know, that's where I want to be?

Spinning 'round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter, oh how I try
I can't sleep in my bed

I've been round for the last time
Oh, girl, what can I do?
Oh the time the web was woven,
How I fell in love, fell in love with you

4860,Guns N' Roses,1991.0,Civil War,"""Use Your Illusion II""","

What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So, you get what we had here, last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
And I don't like it any more than you men

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
An' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
An' all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
An' are washed away by your genocide
An' history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?
An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
An' I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied
For all, I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on, as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
An' all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no, no, no

Ooh, I don't need one more war
No no no, no whoa, no whoa

Spirit on the water 
Darkness on the face of the deep 
I keep thinking about you baby 
I can hardly sleep 

I'm traveling by land 
Traveling through the dawn of day 
You're always on my mind 
I can't stay away

I had forgotten about you 
Then you turned up again 
I always knew 
We were meant to be more than friends 

When you're near 
It's just as plain as it can be 
I'm wild about you, girl
You ought to be a fool about me 

Can't explain 
The sources of this hidden pain 
You burned your way into my heart 
You got the key to my brain 

I've been trampling through mud 
Praying to the powers above 
I'm sweating blood 
You got a face that begs for love 

Life without you 
Doesn't mean a thing to me 
If I can't have you 
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea 

Sometimes I wonder 
Why you can't treat me right 
You do good all day 
And then you do wrong all night 

When you're with me 
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say 
What does it matter 
What price I pay?

They brag about your sugar 
Brag about it all over town 
Put some sugar in my bowl

Holding a blossom on a stem 
You ever seen a ghost?  
No, but you have heard of them 

I see you there 
I'm blinded by the colors I see 
I'll take good care 
Of what belongs to me 

I hear your name 
Ringing up and down the line 
I'm saying it plain 
These ties are strong enough to bind 

Now your sweet voice 
Calls out from some old familiar shrine 
I've got no choice 
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind 

I could live forever 
With you perfectly 
You don't ever 
Have to make a fuss over me

Ever since the world began 
I only mean it for the best 
I want to be with you in any way that I can

Now I'm feeling the wall 
I'm going away baby 
I won't be back until fall 

High on the hill 
You can carry all my thoughts with you 
You've numbed my will 
This love could tear me in two 

I want be with you in paradise 
And it seems so unfair 
I can't go to paradise no more 
I killed a man back there 

You think I'm over the hill 
You think I'm past my prime

We can have a whopping good time

I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated

Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day,
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all,
You never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me whichever road I choose you'll go

I don't know why I'm scared 'cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all,
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts

I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
I Know it ain't easy, giving up your heart

(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy, giving up your heart

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts
Come on and give me a chance
To prove that I'm the one who can
Walk that mile until the end starts.

Whatever
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this - on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet)... in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn)... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Having this happening (this happening)
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is... ""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions (fucking questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy)... I can't take it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Where did we go wrong
Is it really over
Where does my heart belong
If it's not with you
We held on to our pride
When we left each other
But what good is pride tonight
When we're all alone
Why did we give up on us so fast
Isn't love supposed to last forever
Oh, what were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
What were we thinking of
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
What were we thinking of
Tonight I stay awake
Wanting just to call you
Knowing my heart would break
If you were not home
So, I never call
And you will never answer
You know the saddest part of all
Is I know you're there
Why do we run from
The arms of love
When we really need each other
More than ever...
Oh, what were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more than love
What were we thinking of
Too late we both discovered
We're lost without each other
What were we thinking of
Oh, both of us thought
We'd find true love with another
Why were we so blind
It was right here all the time
What were we thinking of
Looking for something better
Reaching for more then love

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you,
How I cried

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
I'll love you 'til I die

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories,
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted?
All that love?

I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
