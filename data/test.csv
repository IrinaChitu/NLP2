Hello, what up? Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you right back

I sense someone's tappin' into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say touch√©?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one

And I hate to say I love you
When it's so hard for me
And I hate to say I want you
When you make it so clear
You don't want me

I'd never ask you 'cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say, I'm sorry, believe me, I love you but not in that way.

And I hate to say I need you
I'm so reliant
I'm so dependent
I'm such a fool

When you're not there,
I find myself singing the blues.
Can't bear,
Can't face the truth

You will never know that feeling
You will never see through these eyes

I'd never ask you 'cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say
You'd say, I'm sorry, believe me, I love you but not in that way.

You'd say, I'm sorry, believe me, I love you but not in that way.

Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby

Fifty women knocking on my door

Everybody's trying to be my baby

I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

Another day that don't end
Another ship goin' out
Another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
I know how it happened
I saw it begin
I opened my heart to the world and the world came in

Hello Mary Lou
Hello Miss Pearl
My fleet-footed guides from the underworld
No stars in the sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too

Well I'm the enemy of treason
Enemy of strife
I'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
I ain't no false prophet
I just know what I know
I go where only the lonely can go

I'm first among equals
Second to none
The last of the best
You can bury the rest
Bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
Put them six feet under and I'll pray for their souls

What are you lookin' at
There's nothing to see
Just a cool breeze that's encircling me
Let's go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountain-side

I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don't care what I drink
I don't care what I eat
I climbed the mountains of swords on my bare feet

You don't know me darlin'
You never would guess
I'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain't no false prophet
I just said what I said
I'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head

Put out your hand
There's nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I'll stuff it with gold
Oh you poor devil look up if you will
The city of God is up there on the hill

Hello stranger
Hello and goodbye
You rule the land
But so do I
You lusty old mule
You got a poison brain
I'll marry you to a ball and chain

You know darlin'
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile something's got to give
I ain't no false prophet
No I'm nobody's bride
Can't remember when I was born
And I forgot when I died

It's time you put away your fear
And it's time try to dream a little big
It's time to give your dreams another chance
And it's time to take away the will in hand

To the flames that's burning strong
To the rain that's coming on
I'll be holding on to memories
I can make it on my own

I believe I'm ready to win
I know I'm ready to soar
If you pick me up when I down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win

They say it's a miracle today (Oh my)
You are never going far today (Hold on)
Life is your chance (Oh no)
You got your chance
Go get your win
It feels like I can fly with broken wings

Now the wind is blowing strong
I can do it on my own
I can do it all alone now
And I'm never turning back again

I believe I'm ready to win (Oh, my friend)
I know I'm ready to soar
If you pick me up when I am down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win

They say I'm dreaming life away
(They say I'm throwing it all away)
And I can't get back my yesterday (Dream again)
So I say I never saw love without you

I believe I'm ready to win (I believe in miracles)
I know I'm ready to soar (Oh my friend)
If you pick me up when I am down
Turn it all around
Cause I know I'm ready to win

Call my name!
(I know I'm ready to win)
And I know I'm ready to win
You and me, baby
I believe it, baby

Sing, yeah!
Baby, I know!

Yeah, yeah, I believe

Walk me over
this horizon
let the sun's light
warm my face
once again the times are changin
once again i lost my way
well the words of ancient poets
fall like dust upon my shoes
grief has robbed me of my vision
turned my heart from higher truths
so take my hand
and lift me higher
be my love and my desire
hold me safe
and honor bound
take my heart to
higher ground
I have walked
too long in darkness
I have walked
too long alone
blindly clutching
fists of diamonds
that i found were only stones
i would trade the world of ages
for a warmer hand to hold
the path of light is narrow
but it leads to streets of gold
so take my hand
and lift me higher
be my love and my desire
hold me safe
and honor bound
take my heart to
higher ground

in this world
we move through shadows
never sure
of what we see
while the truth that lies between us
come and share the truth with me
so take my hand
and lift me higher
be my love and my desire
hold me safe
and honor bound
take my heart to
higher
higher ground

I just thought I heard a small voice crying
Looked again and saw that it was me
I feel like a little boy denying
That he fears the night 'cause he can't see

Then a larger thought said stop your crying
Don't be scared to search 'cause you may find
Fate holds out a candle for your footsteps
Time rolls back the shadows of your mind

It's a long, long lonely night
You can make the morning if you try
It's a long, long lonely night
Oh, we can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I
Together, together, together 

Loneliness is darkness' first companion
Spend the night alone and faith may bend
Share it all and see how fear starts fading
Chase away the shadows with a friend

Dawn's elusive light is just beginning
Now the day can push away the night
Dreams can make the sun feel much brighter
Hope creates a foothold for the light

It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try
Girl, we can make the morning you and I, Oh
Together 

It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try 
It's a long, long lonely night
We can make the morning if we try

It must have been the mistletoe
The lazy fire, the falling snow
The magic in the frosty air
That feeling everywhere
It must have been the pretty lights
That glistened in the silent night
It maybe just the stars so bright
That shined above you
Our first Christmas
More than we'd be dreaming of
Old Saint Nicholas had his fingers crossed
That we would fall in love!
It could have been the holiday,
The midnight ride upon sleigh
The countryside all dressed in white
That crazy snowball fight!
It could have been the steeplebell
That wrapped us up within it's spell
It only took one kiss to know
It must have been the mistletoe!
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of
Old St. Nicholas must have know that kiss
Would lead to all of this!
It must have been the mistletoe
The lazy fire, the falling snow
The magic in the frosty air
That made me love you!
On Christmas eve our wish came true
That night I fell in love with you
It only took one kiss to know
It must have been the mistletoe!
It must have been the mistletoe!
It must have been the mistletoe!

Oh I didn't mean to fall in deep
But I've no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed

I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt
It's time I left

And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now, I won't take it lying down

All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live

And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down
And I can hear you when you speak your poison

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above

You're gonna be a beautiful woman
Because you're such a beautiful child
And when you start to bloom 
Just like a rose in June
I bet the schoolboys all go wild, but right now

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know

Your life's still a lollipop heaven
Your teddy bear's at the foot of your bed
The little boy next door who only makes you sore
Is gonna some day turn your head but right now

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go
Your time hasn't come yet baby
When it does your heart will know

You're gonna grow over night into a lady
With a devastatingly smile
And then a lucky guy will see you
And wanna walk you down the aisle, but meanwhile

Your time hasn't come yet baby
You got a few dreams to go

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play
We're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee (whoosh)
There goes Mama, splashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby

Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

Heart ache, heart break
All over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door

And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

Time flew, cut through
All over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store

You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget!

And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
( you betta have your gat in hand cause man )

Our lifestyles be close captioned
addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture or the
repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know
Would always smile Hello
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause
It's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

Now I've been looking for someone
Trying to find the right boy to wear on my arm
I must admit it
You simply fit it
You were like a cut above the rest, that's why you're winning (hey)

Every night when I close my eyes, I can see you
My perfect type
And I never really thought my dreams would come true,
Until I laid eyes on you
'cause you know you are

Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

You're my boyfriend material, boyfriend material (boy)

Boyfriend material, m-m-material, want everyone to know

That you and your perfect smile
Are both timeless and never going out of style
There's so many reasons you got it together
And I'm catching feelings, you make me look better (better)

Every night when I close my eyes, I can see you
My perfect type
And I never really thought my dreams would come true,

It's all the little things that you do, make me wanna sing
There ain't any other
By the way you're talking to me, I can tell you've been listening
To everything

And maybe it's the butterflies I get every time I hear your ringtone (ringtone)
And maybe it's 'cause every single text, boy, I told myself you were the one

Boyfriend material

[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Nicki Minaj:]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, This nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)

But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Nicki Minaj:]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Skylar Grey:]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Oh, mama liked the roses she grew them in the yard
But Winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
Oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time
She'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see
When I hear the Sunday bells ringing in the morning
I remember crying when she used to sing
Oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared
About the way we learned to live
And if we said our prayers

You know I kept the family bible
With a rose that she saved inside
It was pressed between the pages
Like it had found a place to hide

Oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way
We bring them every Mother's Day
And put them on her grave
Oh, mama liked the roses, mmm
Mama liked the roses

Twenty women, twenty women by my side
I'm gonna kiss them all, because I've gotta keep 'em satisfied
Gonna have the best time money can buy

You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever

Gonna go back, gonna catch that midnight plane
Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
Gonna have a ball, I ain't gonna waste no time
I'm gonna make 'em all mine on a harem holiday

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andr√© from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney ‚Äî Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

All I know is

But it's still alright to be nice

Yankee toes and Eskimos
Can turn to frozen ice
When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
There'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that we had
Held on to the day
Seize the day

I don't mean to be wrong
I don't need to be right
I'm okay on a sunny day
When the world deserves to be bright

Dinosaurs and Santa Claus
Will stay indoors tonight
When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
There'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that we had
Held on to the day
Seize the day
Seize the day

I bless the day
When you came into my life
And I could finally roll back the blind
You helped me to realise
Love was the greatest prize
I only had to open my mind
Seize the day

Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day

I don't care to be bad
I prefer to think twice

But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part

Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you

Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you‚Äôve chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there‚Äôs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle‚Äôs crumbled
And you‚Äôre left with just a name

Where‚Äôs your crown,
King Nothing?
Where‚Äôs your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you‚Äôve chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there‚Äôs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle‚Äôs crumbled
And you‚Äôre left with just a name
Where‚Äôs your crown, King Nothing?
Where‚Äôs your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don‚Äôt care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there‚Äôs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle‚Äôs crumbled
And you‚Äôre left with just a name

Where‚Äôs your crown, King Nothing?

You‚Äôre just nothing
Where‚Äôs your crown, King Nothing?

You've thrown stilettos across the room and almost knocked out my front teeth
You've thrown my clothes out on the lawn, yeah you walked away from me
Only to come back like the moon in the evening but it seems
That something's changed in you and it's just so hard to believe

That if I had a dollar everytime you said you're never coming back, I'd be rich, I'd be rich
But I get the impression that this time it's the exception to the rule, I'll admit

It's the way you say goodbye, let's me know that it's for real
You walked away so many times, it's different I can feel it
When I call you won't reply, won't give me one more chance, walked away so many times
But it's the way you say, the way you say, the way you say goodbye, oh...
The way you say goodbye, oh oh oh

Now I know that we are doomed, yeah I know that it's the end
There's no more smelling your perfume, no more lying in your bed
No more tell me about your day or the worries on your mind
Cause there's nothing left to say, I can see it in your eyes

If I had a dollar everytime you said you're never coming back, I'd be rich (yeah), I'd be rich (uh-huh)
But I get the impression that this time it's the exception to the rule, oh... I'll admit this is it

It's the way you say goodbye, let's me know that it's for real
You walked away so many times, it's different I can feel it
When I call you won't reply, won't give me one more chance, you walked away so many times

Never got to sing my songs for you

Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love you pay your dues

Say that happiness cannot be measured
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures
What a joke

I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, Love yourself.
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, Love yourself.

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love I've paid my dues

Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather
What a shame, who's to blame?

Hey, you caught me in a coma and I don't think I
Wanna ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma 'cause no one's ever gonna
Oh, make me come back to this world again
Now, I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure, and I like it this way
But my body's calling, my body's calling:
Won't you come back to this world again?
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end, I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily, my friends are calling back to me
I said, they're, they're leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin' on
Goddamn it

Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

Help me
Okay, let's get this guy in the program please, we're losing him. Start an IV Please.
Help Me
Come on... His airways.. someone's got to protect his airways. I want two...
Where's the defibrillator?
Two IV's over here, please. That's two more now. We're losing him
Let's go
Help Me
Slow-motion here. This guy's going...
Bastard
Let's get him in ER
...Going out on us
Who's got the defibrillator?

Please understand me

I'm climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
Waiting for you, where are you?

No one's going to bother me anymore
No one's going to mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fighting's for
But it's so nice here, down off the shore
I wish you could see this, 'cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live, ah

I know
Okay, we're starting to lose this guy. I want that IV and his airway protected!
Let's get some people in here!
Get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy. He's going... Give me an airway please
... Going under.

Zap him again
How about an IV, stat?
Okay... you better protect the airway, you're starting to lose him. clear!
Zap the son of a bitch again

Don't walk away from me!
'You are such a fucking prick, I am so pissed with you
Get back over here!
All I hear is bullshit, all the time

I just don't give a shit anymore
I love you

You live your life like it's a coma, won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
With all the reasons you give, it's, it's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason why you should stay?
Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway
You got a one-way ticket, on your last chance ride
Got a one-way ticket to your suicide
Got a one-way ticket, and there's no way out alive
An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
They be down by the water while you watch 'em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing it was nobody's fault, but your own
There were always ample warnings, there were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin' but we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening, why'd your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An' it's so easy to be social, it's so easy to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
But I'm still out here, waiting, watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking, know it's gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories that another man would need just to survive

Well, I wake up in the morning
There's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's hidin'
Inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearin'
A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?

Well, I go to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

Well, I asked for something to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta think you're really weird

Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real

Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
Little mailman comes in
Even he's got to take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?

Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight

And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit

Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it

We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
Did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is evol
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breath away
You're a supernova... and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you

I took a walk for the very first time on the dark side of the dance floor,
Lit a match just to heat things up but I got more than I bargained for;

Mixed drinks, mixed feelings of elation,
I should have known it was a one night invitation.

Don't sweat it, forget it, everything is a-ok.
Just let it, go then it's, off to find another face,
I make you come just to watch you leave,
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve.
Don't sweat it, it's over now, our time ran out.

I took an oath, but I'm giving it up, you didn't have to see things my way.
Nothing more than a casual fuck - isn't that just how we operate.

Let's drink to feelings of temptation
You and I, we're an over-night sensation.

Don't sweat it, forget it, everything is a-ok.
Just let it, go then it's, off to find another face,
I make you come just to watch you leave,
I walk around with your heart on my sleeve.
Don't sweat it, it's over now, our time ran...

Outside, the brake lights started to dim,
I feel the tension that's been pulling us in.
And then we do it again, so we can feel alright.
Falling in love for the night.

Don't sweat it, forget it, everything is a-ok.
Just let it, go then it's, off to find another face,
I make you come just to watch you leave,
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve.

Et partir o√π mon c≈ìur me pousse.
Je voudrais retrouver mes traces
O√π est ma vie, o√π est ma place,
Et garder l'or de mon pass√©
Au chaud dans mon jardin secret.

Je voudrais passer l'oc√©an,
Croiser le vol d'un go√©land,
Penser √† tout ce que j'ai vu,
Ou bien aller vers l'inconnu.
Je voudrais d√©crocher la lune,
Je voudrais m√™me sauver la Terre
Mais avant tout
Je voudrais parler √† mon p√®re,
Parler √† mon p√®re.

Je voudrais choisir un bateau,
Pas le plus grand ni le plus beau,
Je le remplirais des images
Et des parfums de mes voyages.
Je voudrais freiner pour m'asseoir,
Trouver au creux de ma m√©moire
Des voix de ceux qui m'ont appris
Qu'il n'y a pas de r√™ve interdit.

Je voudrais trouver les couleurs,
Des tableaux que j'ai dans le c≈ìur,
De ce d√©cor aux lignes pures,
O√π je vous vois et me rassure.
Je voudrais d√©crocher la lune,
Je voudrais m√™me sauver la Terre,
Mais avant tout,
Je voudrais parler √† mon p√®re,
Parler √† mon p√®re.

Je voudrais oublier le temps
Pour un soupir, pour un instant,
Une parenth√®se apr√®s la course,
Et partir o√π mon c≈ìur me pousse.
Je voudrais retrouver mes traces
O√π est ma vie, o√π est ma place,
Et garder l'or de mon pass√©
Au chaud dans mon jardin secret.

Je voudrais partir avec toi,
Je voudrais r√™ver avec toi,
Toujours chercher l'inaccessible,
Toujours esp√©rer l'impossible,
Je voudrais d√©crocher la lune,
Et pourquoi pas sauver la Terre,
Mais avant tout
Je voudrais parler √† mon p√®re
Parler √† mon p√®re
Je voudrais parler √† mon p√®re
Parler √† mon p√®re.

_x000D_
A child that hides behind a chair
Almost afraid to grow
Without you there
Whisper words that make you see
What you've come to mean to me

A voice that rises from the heart
The hunger seizes me
And tears my soul apart
And serving only to renew
How I came to feel for you

Through your love I'd see forever
We became as one
I never saw you turn away
My love was blind
You call me when your storm is over
Crying over love that I can give you
When the night is colder
Holding on to me

'Cause it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
With your face that lies
You memorize the reason why

And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go

Foolish that I still believe
That love should never die
It makes me cry to witness where the story ends
All the lovers in the world
Will echo all the words
That I will leave you
When the night is lonely
Only goes to show

That it's so hard letting go
And it's so hard not to cry
And I kneel and pray for yesterday
When you were mine

And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
It's so hard letting go.

Black magic, night walker (Yeah)
She haunts me like no other (Feel like)
Nobody told me (I don't know) love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (But it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (It's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains

[Eminem:]
We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (Yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (Sneeze)
Last time, I broke her collar bone, she's intolerable (Yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phenomenal, though
We're an unlikely pair (Yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (Yeah)
People don't like us together, but like we care (Not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (Yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals
For her with both of my feet bare (Yeah)
But soon as I ask to hit (Ask to hit)
It's like she grabs a switch (Grabs a switch)
And turns me over her knee
'Cause my ass is whipped, yeah
And I got her back, but I'm spineless (Yeah)
So when she stabs me in mine (Yeah)
It's like I just can't feel the knife (What?)
As she pokes, jabs it, and slices
One minute, she'll build me up (Up)
The next, she'll push me 'round
Probably why she calls me dumbbell
She lifts me up (Yeah), then puts me down (Huh)
But I am under her thumbnail
I must be under her spell
It's like lookin' right into a gun barrel
But none of these hoes can fuck with my girl
She got that‚Äî

We wake up, break up, make up like Maybelline
Now she's all made up like make-believe
Probably why she's so fake to me
But what the fuck's it gonna take for me to make her see?
Strip her naked and take her keys
I been plannin' this day for weeks
But I can't tell if I'm 'wake or 'sleep
But if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain
I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
But her by her motherfuckin' hair's
All I imagine draggin' (Dragon)
She lunges, attacks, and scratches
But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
Like Kaep for the National Anthem
As I stab, I'm laughin'
So much for witchcraft and magic
Abracadabra that, bitch
No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
I give her one last hug goodbye
Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
But in hindsight
Think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
As I pop another five Vic's
That's what this high's like
Look down, there's mud on my Nikes
Shovel at my side, blood on my mic
Now wake up to Music To Be Murdered By like‚Äî

Roads that we run down

Many chains to unravel

You'll be looking at the future

So, keep your feet upon the ground
And get ready to run

Hear me, sisters and brothers

Hide behind the filling station
I can feel the bloodhounds sniffing and getting closer
I need to leave town 'cause I just shot down an officer

A convict and I'm wanted
Two strikes and this will make three
They beat me down like Rodney
A victim of brutality, it was self defense, self defense.

The moment when they stash that contraband in my car
Didn't do nothing illegal
But I've been set up to be the one to take the fall

I can pin this on, yah hear me?

Just another routine stop 'cause I was speedin
Thought they just give me a ticket and I'd be leaving
Little that I know I was a part of a bigger plot bad drug deal orchestrated by a crooked cop
Why so many of em, in one spot
Something isn't right, no is just not
But before I could figure out what was going on
I was on the ground getting beat up and stomped on
I'm half dead, I'm half dead
What did I do to deserve this
I must escape before they kill a nigga
I grabbed the gun from his holster and pulled the triger

A Convict and I'm wanted
Two strikes and this will make three
They beat me down like Rodney
A victim of brutality, it was self defense, self defense.

Carried along on the breeze
Even the flowers are swaying in time
With the leaves on the trees

You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible

If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no

Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting

Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting

Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I composed the music of the night

Night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender

Hearing is believing, music is deceiving
Hard as lightning, soft as candle light

There you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes
For your eyes will only tell the truth

And the truth isn't what you want to see
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be

Softly

Music shall caress you

Hear it

Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes and let music set you free

Only then can you belong to me

Floating (floating), falling (falling)
Sweet intoxication
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me)
Savour each sensation

Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

Help me make the music of the night

What a scene!

Over men and horses, hoops and garters,
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way 
Mr. K.
Will challenge the world!

The celebrated Mr. K.
Performs his feat on Saturday
At Bishopsgate.

The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring.
Don't be late!

Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none.
And of course
Henry The Horse
Dances the waltz!

The band begins at ten to six,
When Mr. K. performs his tricks
Without a sound.

And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake 
On solid ground.

Having been some days in preparation,
A splendid time is guaranteed for all.
And tonight

Is topping the bill!

Love don't live here anymore (anymore)

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay
Another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore (anymore)

In the windmills of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me (me)
Why'd ya have to go away? (away)
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Live here anymore
Love don't live here anymore
Don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
No, no, you don't, you don't live here anymore

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
No, you don't live here anymore
Love don't here anymore
(Love don't live here anymore)
You don't live here anymore

There is one love I should never have crossed

I should have known she would win in the end

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me

Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall

A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling for ever

Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

To escape the love that I will forever know

Where can we go from here

Sometimes we do things against our will
I know I cry lonely tears
Where can we go from here

Why, why do I cry inside
When love is gone away
And how, how can I carry on
When I know all the love is gone

Life by Marshall Mathers

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground

What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises to hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life

I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore
After work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on Nobody's As Ill As Me
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying Where Hip-Hop Lives

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word

And we just don't leave 'cause we like it here
Making shack of love inside our heads

He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can‚Äôt answer him back
I‚Äôm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it‚Äôs to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won‚Äôt ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won‚Äôt ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won‚Äôt ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

The time we share

Out there the winds
Are bitter cold
And there is too much pain
And far too little love
To few others who care

Is all that we own in the world
And love's the refuge
That sees us through
Sleep inside my arms

Punctuate it with the moaning, it's so real

You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long

If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like Hell, the river Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey

When the event happens, there is little time to think of those things that people would like to have remain private
Getting caught up in the circus-like atmosphere, feeling less responsible to conventional ethical practices

Never good, just the bad and the ugly
Laid in front of you
Nothing quite like seeing the world through the TV's window
Feeling helpless I look for distraction
I go searching for you, 
Wandering through our city to find some solace at your door

I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
Tell me did you see the news tonight

Hold me in this wild, wild world
Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close

So come on let's forget the emotion
Tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes
Deafen me with music
'Till we're lost in the heat of the moment
And I'm moving in you
Help me keep these hours alive
Help me chase those seconds

I just keep talking about it
But I'll do nothing about it
Tell me did you see the news last night

Hold me in this wild, wild world
Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold you can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close

Hold me in this wild, wild world

Hold me in this wild, wild world
Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
So draw me close, draw me close

Shock, horror, I'm down,
Lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest
That sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on auto-pilot,
And my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down,
Lay it down next to me.

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you and I miss you

These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching,
Constrict them- suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture I'm painting
And my belly's sick to it's stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
You lay down next to me.

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you
More than I let on
I kissed you
Far too long
I'll let go as soon as you do
See I know we're not through

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you, that I miss you, whoa-oh-oh-oh.

I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you.

Deep down in Louisianna
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B.Goode!

Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake,
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Night after night, Day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circlin' around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rising men
Just like you my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must to slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?
You bastard! I'm supposed to respect you!
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtue first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own.

You get your lover in the bed
Come here I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I play in blood, but not my own.

3 P.M. on my feet and staggering
Through misplaced words and a sinking feeling
I got carried away
Sick, sick of sleeping on the floor
Another night, another score
I'm jaded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times - let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?

Stella would you take me home?

2 A.M. I'm on a blackout binge again
You know I don't need sleep
And I lost my keys
But I've got so many friends
And they keep, keep me coming back for more
Another night, another score
I'm faded, bottles breaking

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love
When I'm falling to the bathroom floor
I remember how you tasted
I've had you so many times - let's face it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?

One more reason I should never have met you
Just another reason I could never forget you
Down we go, the rooms spinning outta control
Lose myself in a chemical moment
The night life's taking it's toll
That's just the way it goes
Come on, Stella would you take me home?

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it
Feels like I'm falling in love alone
Stella would you take me home?

You're only happy when I'm wasted
I point my finger but I just can't place it

In this masquerade, she can't feel the pain
Cover up her heart, with a little paint
While he's pulling out a flask, to hide it all away
There's nothing left to say

He knows that they're drowning
She hopes that there's still something left
Let go now cause he's leaving

But she'd be fine pretending, things were alright
Even while its ending keep it inside
She can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
Even when she says she'll open her eyes
All her words are empty when she denies
But she can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
But she'd be fine prete... (she'd be fine)

Step into the light, to look him in the eye
Feeling so exposed, she tries to stay composed
But every little fight and every little lie is impossible to hide

He knows that they're drowning
She hopes that there's still something left
Let go now cause he's leaving

But she'd be fine pretending, things were alright
Even while its ending keep it inside
She can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
Even when she says she'll open her eyes
All her words are empty when she denies
But she can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?
But she'd be fine prete... (she'd be fine)

I hate to watch her hurt, I know it isn't right
But she can find the courage to leave it all behind
I wish I had the words to help her realize
That there is just no way to bring this back to life

He knows that, they're drowning

But she'd be fine pretending, things were alright
Even while its ending keep it inside
She can feel them bending
All their love is pending, so what is she defending?
Even when she says she'll open her eyes
All her words are empty when she denies
But she can feel them bending
All their love is pending so what is she defending?

Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul

Girl, girl, girl
You gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go

Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn to smoke
But I feel fine

Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer
The flames are now lickin' my body
Please won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breath
And my chest is a-heaving

Lord Almighty
I'm burning a hole where I lay

Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

With burning love
Ah, ah, burning love
I'm just a hunk 
A hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the sun, when the rain's so full of life
Who needs the sky, when the ground's open wide
It's here in your arms I want to be buried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs a smile, when a tear's so full of love
Who needs a home, with the stars up above
It's here in your heart I want to be carried
You are my sanctuary

Who needs the light, with the darkness in your eyes
Who needs to sleep, with the stars in the sky
It's here in your soul I want to be married
You are my sanctuary

And the earth was void and empty
And darkness was upon the face of the earth

Is all of this pain so necessary
You are my sanctuary

Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice
Him or her I shall follow
As the water follows the moon, silently

Who needs the sun (with fluid steps)
Who needs the sky (around the globe)
Who needs to sleep (I hear your voice)
You are (you are) my sanctuary
You are (you are, you are)
You are (you are) my sanctuary

I‚Äôm getting very edgy
Cos you‚Äôre trying to take this from me
And it‚Äôs something that I wanted so bad
Cos you‚Äôre the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you‚Äôre a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It‚Äôs your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what‚Äôs wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I‚Äôm losing sleep
I live only for the week

I‚Äôve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you‚Äôre not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don‚Äôt care as long as you‚Äôre mine
It‚Äôs happening every time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what‚Äôs wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I‚Äôm losing sleep
I live only for the week

And I‚Äôm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can‚Äôt sleep although I think I can
It‚Äôs insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I‚Äôm not your man?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I‚Äôm losing sleep
I live only for the week

Here's to us. One more toast, and then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither You nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed, with nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

Set up the shooters, it's time for a drop

Down at the hatch, Jack, the women and the fun

Beam me up, Jim, it's time to come in

This one's on me, here's mud in your eye

[Partial Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Verse 1:]
I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

Honey, it's rainin' tonight
But storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me your cover tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies...

You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me, we're the same force
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light

But did you know, did you know, did you know, know

As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?

Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal, and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun,
Steals a car,
Tries to run,
But he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

And as her young man dies,
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

I'm looking through you, where did you go
I thought I knew you, what did I know
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

Buggin' and wheezin'

It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin' you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
I love you (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down

We'll start it off with caviar, Dom P√©rignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the women that I'm speakin' to
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do
So, now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the n√©glig√©e

In candy apple red
Dressed up like a fire
Burning through my head

And offered her a drink
Who took me to the graveyard
And we did the trick or treat

Before I learned her name
We were already asleep
When I woke up in my coffin
She was nowhere to be seen
Was it all a dream?
Who can I believe?
It can't be what it seems
It was only Halloween
What does it all mean?

Weren't you just so fortunate
But you moved out on your own
Thought that things would come easier
But you can't always get what you want

When the world gets a little bit colder
And the sky gets a little bit dark
The drugs you were taking won't fix you
And the distance won't heal your heart

Cause life ain't easy out on your own
When the price of living is a bank loan
Well tell me it's worth it
To run from your home
I'll tell you your insane, out of control
And what is it like to be crazy?
Why don't you tell me?
What is it like?

It was just too obvious how you felt no compromise
Every time they handed you a dollar from their pocket only made you feel justified
You say it's heartache
But I know it's a lie
They bought all your explanations
And sold all your goodbyes

Cause life ain't easy out on your own
When the price of living is a bank loan
Well tell me it's worth it
To run from your home
I'll tell you your insane, out of control
And what is it like to be crazy?
Why don't you tell me?
What is it like?

Run away, run away, run away, run away, run away for your sacred Sundays
The only way, only way, only way, only way you forget your Mondays
Runaway, run away

Cause life ain't easy out on your own
When the price of living is a bank loan
Well tell me it's worth it
To run from your home

You left with no goodbye.
Not a single word was said,
No final kiss to seal any sins.
I had no idea of the state we were in.

And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.

But don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember me once more.

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong.
The more I do, the less I know.

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.

But don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember me once more.

Gave you the space so you could breathe,
I kept my distance so you would be free,
And hoped that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me.

Why don't you remember,
Don't you remember

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Oh, oh

(We'll understand it all by and by)
Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong

Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

Good morning ah

Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street

After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning
Good morning ah

People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

Good morning, good morning, good

Out of every childhood story, surely

Remind me of Alicia Keys verse

I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you now I'm here living with regrets

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't lose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first so

One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo

Gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds

Thinking back I ain't seen you in ages
Wishing that I coulda made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as

Or a mountain that's so high
Just by seeing is believing
I don't need to question why
When I see a mighty ocean
That rushes to the shore

If I ever had cause to doubt Him
I don't doubt Him anymore
Oh seeing, seeing, seeing is believing
And I see him everywhere
In the mountains, in the valley
Yes I know my God is there
Oh, in time I look above me
See the stars that fill the sky
How could there be any question
Only God can reach that high

End of night a new day dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach

Summer night city
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
Ah-ah

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park

In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my -pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
Well I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling out at last

Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

This ol' airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way

(My darling.
When you burnt that toast the other morning
I, I looked into you eyes and I could see that National Health eyeball
and I loved you, like I never done, I have never done before!)

Oh darling

And you'll be mine
You will be mine
You'll be mine

It was you that took my soul
And threw it in the fire
And tamed it in the rapture
And filled me with desire
Now I'm pure, now I'm clean
I feel cured and serene in you

There is no denying
How I have been changed
You won't hear me crying
Now misery is strange
I can dream, I can fly
Now it seems I get by with you

Goodbye pain
Goodbye again

I was always looking
Looking for someone
Someone to stick my hook in
Pull it out and run
Now I'm caught on your line
All my thoughts are entwined in you

Goodbye pain
Goodbye again

If you see me walking
To the Golden Gates
Turn around, start talking
Stop and hesitate
I'll be waiting up there
With my fate in the air for you

Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye 
Good goodbye

I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)

Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three SWATs or police officers at least to come pull me
off of it and I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling Bombs away on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBen√©t me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop K.Dot to Shady

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say Abracadabra and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse

Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBen√©t me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

Ah, okay!
The hills are alive
And it's pretty frightening
The sun goes down
The moon comes out
The people gather 'round and we all begin to shout
Ech... Mud!
You better not cry
You better not shout
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is dead
I was sitting on a hill
And I was looking at the sky
And that's when a strange
Looking object caught my eye
I tried to run away
Burt I couldn't even stand
And the great big flying saucer
Came in to land
then the cabin opened up
And a handsome man got out
And he was so good looking that I
Wanted to shout
He was smiling right at me
I was falling for his charms
And only one thing bothered me
He had eleven arms
Then he started in to talk
The stranger from the stars
He said my name is Marty
And I come from Mars
So I listened while he told
The story of his life
He said he'd come here
Straight from Mars
To find a wife
I said Marty tell me this
I said Marty tell me true
How come you got eleven arms
When I got only two
but the martian gave a wink
And he told me with a shrug
We need them all to hug and hug
It sounded good to me
So I said I'd be his wife
And fly around with him
For the rest of my life
He walked back up the hill
We both were feeling grand
yes, we both back to his flying saucer
Hand in hand in hand in hand in hand...
In haaaaaaaaaand!

Breathe the air and feel the sun on my children's face

I can see a clearer picture
When I touch the ground, I come full circle
To my place and I am home

I want to let go of all disappointment that's waiting for me
What I want is to live forever
Not defined by time and space
It's a lonely place

And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan

But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well I guess this is growing up

And maybe 
I'll see you 
at a movie 
sneak preview
You'll show up 
and walk by 
on the arm 
of that gay guy
And I'll smile 
and you'll wave 
we'll pretend 
it's okay

it won't last 
when he's gone 
I won't come back

And it'll happen once again

And sees through the master plan

I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues

Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
She was the only daugther of an enginer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I gotta go mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues

Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I wanna go I never can go

I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,

Never been known as my government name,
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain,
And now you sit before me with a folder holding my story, you're my savior with nothing on me but power and glory,

And surely you'll never ignore me, 'cause when the the call came
The court date was made to disappear for me,
You think you understand me but never what I went through
But you were never meant to I won't hold it against you,

I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in my forearms,
Forget me not never let me stop
You'll just sit and watch it's your job to be patient so you'll let me off,

So come with me take a walk on the wild side,
See life in a day through a child's eyes,
And these dreams are all I have to hold me,
When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away, away,

Okay, session's over time to get back to the classroom,
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too,
You told me I should try my best but guess what?
I still find this trigonometry a head fuck,

Constantly told I won't pass my GCSE's,
I'll end up in Micky D's serving burgers and cheese,
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it,
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,

Lately classmates think I'm crazy, turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey,
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it hard to do,
So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home,

So come with me take a walk on the wild side
See life in a day through a child's eyes,
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,
When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away, away.

Forgive me
Don't know where to start
I guess we've come to
The serious part
I need to find out
If there's a chance
For us...

Don't give me that same old look
It won't win me over
Don't give me that same old speech
You don't have to speak at all

You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
Cuz when a man loves a woman it is all
In his touch

I wish you could see (yeah)
Just how simple
It's supposed to be

'Cause now that we've come this far
We don't want to lose it
If you wanna win my heart
Baby just shut your mouth

You can say you love me
That I'm your perfect crush
How it hurts to need someone that much
You can swear you mean it
But that ain't good enough
Cuz when a man loves a woman it is all
In his touch...

...then words don't mean that much

[Yelawolf:]
For fuck's sake, yeah
Yelawolf, Melody Man

[Ed Sheeran:]
Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I've been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey

[Yelawolf:]
It's kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I'm stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say

[Ed Sheeran:]
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Yelawolf:]
Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I'm a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I'm a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy's home, on the mic, hey papa

[Ed Sheeran:]
Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I'm taking their ears on a journey
Like I'm flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin' so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I've been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I'm riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy's Lambo

[Yelawolf:]
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You're probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal's done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow

[Ed Sheeran:]
If you don't know
If you don't know by now, you better tell him 'bout it
What you gonna tell him 'bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Yelawolf:]
I'm not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I'm goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who's a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I'm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war, you don't want it
Shady Records, I'm already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don't gotta lead, dog's already home, Jack
Dogg I'm a beast, I'm a wolf, bring your dogs back (Woof !)
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man

[Ed Sheeran & {Yelawolf}:]
Been working hard all week
{So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably}
So won't you bring that back to me
{And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween}
I got blisters on my feet
{To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing}
So won't you bring that back to me
'{Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don't know}

Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing ?

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean.

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona ?

Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.

That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin' ?

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow.

I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.

Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'.

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

Things are shaping up to be pretty odd
Little deaths in musical beds
So it seems I'm someone I've never met

You will only hear these elegant crimes
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth

Everybody gets there and everybody gets their, and everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I'm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I want to go where everyone goes
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same

I never said I'd leave the city
I never said I'd leave this town
A falling out we won't tiptoe about

Everybody gets there and everybody gets their, and everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I'm the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I feel the same, and I say

(Well things have changed for me, come on everyone let's dance and sing)
I feel the same, and I say

But you don't seem to have inherited many of his mannerisms

And make you aware of being alive

Someone to pull you up short
And put you through hell
And give you support for being alive-being alive
Make me alive, make me confused
Mock me with praise, let me be used
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!

Somebody hold me too close
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
I'll always be there
As frightened as you of being alive,
Being alive, being alive!

Someone you have to let in
Someone whose feelings you spare
Someone who, like it or not
Will want you to share a little, a lot of being alive
Make me alive, make me confused
Mock me with praise, let me be used
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!

Somebody crowd me with love
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
I'll always be there
As frightened as you to help us survive,
Being alive, being alive, being alive, being alive

[Eminem:]
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Eminem (Cheech and Chong):]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a (big rockstar)

[Eminem:]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Eminem (Cheech and Chong):]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar

[Eminem:]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say Die N-word than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be capped in America like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the Land of the Free that made people slaves to build

[Logic:]
They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble
Than go through the trouble
Of having they double-double vision corrected
They just neglect it and-
I've been thinkin' lately
Will the Devil take me?
Or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

[Sam Smith:]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat na√Øve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Logic:]
I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passin' judgements
I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me
I know there's others like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line, that's fine, I'll take it all
Well Logic, He gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
Can you hear me?
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

[Sam Smith:]
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

Oh, I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you
No, but I'm gonna pray

It's the calm before the storm right here
Wait, how was I gonna start this off?
I forgot‚Ä¶ oh, yeah

That's an awfully hot coffee pot
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk
I'ma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks
She gets her mou‚Äîahh, I'ma stop
But we better give Obama props
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze
That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust
And while the drama pops
And he waits for shit to quiet down he'll just gas his plane up and fly around 'til the bombing stops
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin'
Trump, when it comes to giving a shit, you're stingy as I am
Except when it comes to having the balls to go against me, you hide 'em
'Cause you don't got the fucking nuts like an empty asylum
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for
'Cause that's how he gets his fucking rocks off and he's orange
Yeah, sick tan
That's why he wants us to disband
'Cause he cannot withstand
The fact we're not afraid of Trump
Fuck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp
That's why he keeps screamin', Drain the swamp!
'Cause he's in quicksand
It's like we take a step forwards then backwards
But this is his form of distraction
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction
When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that in
-stead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers
Then says he wants to lower our taxes
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered
Then does it more
From his endorsement of Bannon
Support for the Klansmen
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black
And comes home from Iraq
And is still told to go back to Africa
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa
Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors
Now if you're a black athlete, you're a spoiled little brat for
Tryna use your platform or your stature
To try to give those a voice who don't have one
He says, You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered
'Cause to him you're zeros
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured
That's not disrespecting the military
Fuck that! This is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch!
He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!
He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks
'Cause like him in politics, I'm using all of his tricks
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
Fuck you!
The rest of America stand up!
We love our military, and we love our country
But we fucking hate Trump!

Well, it's always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever it could be, makes me think you've seen me before
Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena

Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
I've tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, you're down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?

She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearin' a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God's truth tell me what you want and you'll have it of course
Just step into the arena

Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weepin' in unholy places
Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)

[Eminem:]
Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackenin'
I know the mark's high, butterflies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

[Beyonc√© (Eminem):]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the, it's the curse of the)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes

[Eminem:]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish, whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, This shit is garbage!
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

[Beyonc√©:]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's, it's true)
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Eminem:]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your expectations and meet 'em, but first
The Speedom verse, now Big Sean
He's going too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause

[Beyonc√©:]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
He may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; Peace and thanks
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

Obie the person that came up introverted

So welcome to the art department

It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)

It's a foregone conclusion, you're love's an illusion
And the picture is starting to fade
Boy let's be honest, when it comes to your promise
It's just a lot of empty words that you say
And the future's only gonna be more of the same
You've only got yourself to blame

Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do you don't
That's a given, it doesn't matter anyway
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't
So when you say you're gonna change you gotta be kidding
Tomorrow you didn't
Hey hey, I'm outta here today

I used to believe in, all your romantic dreaming
But it really ain't that cute anymore
'Cause my time's too precious
So I wish you the best with
Whatever it is you're looking for
Baby this is all for your own good
I'm leaving 'cause I know you never would

Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do you don't
That's a given, it doesn't matter anyway
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't
So when you say you're gonna change you gotta be kidding
Tomorrow you didn't
Hey hey, I'm outta here today

I don't need a crystal ball to see it all my dear
It doesn't matter what you say
It always turns out the same way
Your predictions are fiction and it's tragically clear (guitar solo)

Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do you don't
That's a given, it doesn't matter anyway
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't
So when you say you're gonna change you gotta be kidding, yeah
Tomorrow you didn't hey
Hey, I'm outta here... I'm outta here today

Made of clay
Shoot me down
I‚Äôll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it‚Äôs over before it‚Äôs begun

I lost my way 
So help me out
And lend your hand ‚Äòtil I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So it‚Äôs up to you
For you to bring those words

I
And I 
Have come undone
For the last time

This grief you give
It takes it‚Äôs toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh

Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time

It don't really matter
Gonna find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter, ooh
Gonna leave this thing to somebody else

If they were missionaries
Real-time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatuation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now

'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got, to rule the nation
When all I've got is precious time

It don't really matter
Guess I'll keep it to myself
Said, it don't really matter (matter, matter)
It's time I look around for somebody else

'Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all we've got is precious time
More than you got, to fool the nation
But all I've got is precious time

It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter (matter, matter)
So you can hear it now from somebody else

You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat 'em enough, they'll die
It's like a walk in the park from a cell
(It don't' really matter)
Now you're keeping your own kind in hell
(It don't' really matter)
When your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself
(It don't' really matter)
While their arms reach out for your help
And you're out of time

These streets are yours, you can keep them
I don't want them
They pull me back, and I surrender
To the memories I run from

Oh, we have paved these streets
With moments of defeat

But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
I won't show my face here anymore

These streets are yours, you can keep them
In my mind it's like you haunt them
And passing through I think I see you
In the shapes of other women

Oh, we have stained these walls
With our mistakes and flaws

But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
I won't show my face here anymore

All that's left behind
Is a shadow on my mind
A shadow on my mind (Oh, a shadow cast upon a wall is silhouette and nothing more)
All that‚Äôs left behind (but it's all that‚Äôs left behind)

But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
I won't show my face here anymore

I won't show my face here anymore
I won't show my face here anymore

The steps that lead to any church
Form a stairway to a star
They're part of God and should be trod
More often than they are

I believe in the man in the sky
I believe with his help I'll get by
My footsteps may falter
My eyes may grow dim
But he's my Gibraltar
I'm trusting in him

Though a sparrow is all I may be
On me he will still keep an eye
Yes I'm singing his praise
Till the end of my days
I believe in the man in the sky

Sparrow, sparrow am I
Keep an eye
Yes I'm singing his praise
Till the end of my days
I believe in the man in the sky

2820,Bob Dylan,1981,The Groom's Still Waiting At The Altar,Shot Of Love,"
_x000D_
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated.
She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated.

East of the Jordan, hard as the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the page, Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery,
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
About the madness of becomin' what one was never meant to be.

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the stage,
Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me.
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated.

West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the cage,
Curtain risin' on a new stage,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better standin' around like furniture.
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it,
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
Keep it.

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the stage, Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

Cities on fire, phones out of order,
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January,
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.

West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I see the burning of the stage,
Curtain risin' on a new age,
See the groom still waitin' at the altar.

The wavelength gently grows
Coercive notions re-evolve
A universe is trapped inside a tear
It resonates the core
Creates unnatural laws
Replaces love and happiness with fear

Oooo

How much deception can you take
How many lies will you create
How much longer until you break
Your mind's about to fall

And they're breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
We are losing control

They're breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
Now we're falling
We are losing control

Invisible to all
The mind becomes a wall
All of history deleted with one stroke

Oooo

How much deception can you take
How many lies will you create
How much longer until you break
Your mind's about to fall

And they're breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
Now we're falling

Tell me what we built this for
On my way to something more
You're that one I can't ignore
Mmm

I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
Mmm

Yeah I know just what you're saying
And I regret ever complaining
About this heart and all its breaking
It was beauty we were making
Mmm

And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you
Mmm

I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace

Songbird sings from the heart
Each word can tear you apart
I sing - you sing along
You find your life in my song
When you need the strength to carry on
You've got me to turn to
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
They've helped you be strong now
The song sets you free
But who sings to me
I'm all alone now
Who sings for songbird
Sometimes
When I' m all alone
I sing my saddest song
Lonely, and no one can see
This time the song is for me
I can touch your secret place inside
And still you don't know me
With the songs that I sing
And the magic they bring
You've learned to be strong now
The song sets you free
But who sings to me
I'm all alone now
Where is my songbird,
Where is my songbird,
Who sings his song for me?

If you want control
Without any pain

You see the friend that I knew
Cannot be found
Replaced by another
Wearing his crown

There's a place where I go
Without any sound
Only you can reach me
Only you're allowed

Then you're so far away
You're so far from here
Do you remember
A time without tears

When you're falling I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far
You can make it, I will be there
You were broken from the start

When you were a child
You'd dream all day long
You'd dream of the future
Get lost in your songs

Now that time is gone
It's lost for you now
Words long forgotten
Forgotten somehow

When you're falling I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far
You can make it, I will be there
You were broken from the start

When you're falling I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far

I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call the cost to splurge
You drive me bonkers, I‚Äôm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date cause I think I gave you power, when I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably should've never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should've been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her
Cause nobody's body's awesomer, I lust it and she loves me
Cause I'm popular, but you know this ain't love

You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)

You were obviously oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
Till I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning

Cause now you see nothing but me, and I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone
Can't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason
This definitive, just need you, talking bout I live and breathe you
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither, bitch

You get on my nerves, you make me sick

I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too
Get the picture
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah
Toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back

She grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right
When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe
Girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights

You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)

That's the sound of love, ripping shades off the wall
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Ooh, this might not be in the bedroom
But I'm gonna love you, girl, gently
Gonna love you gently, ooh
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Let me touch you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently (ah babe, ah baby)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock

Ooh, can you feel me, girl?
Aye, uh huh
We don't need no room
All we need is me and you, aye
Wanna love you

Yesterday, I slipped away
The sun is welcoming the evening shadows
On a perfect day and the next step is love
The next step is love

We walked barefoot through the misty meadows
Laughing at each other in the rain
Made some faces at some people in the park
Didn't bother to explain
Fun, fun, look at us run
Going nowhere special really fast
But we've yet to taste the icing on the cake
That we've been baking with the past

And the next step is love
So what are we waiting for?
The next step is love
Girl, it's for sure

Love will be a place to run to
From the world they've built to you and me
We'll be closer than we've ever been
Though looking back it's so hard to believe
Hang it all out or bring it all in
The best we've picked upon the way tonight
Changes are coming but together
We can make it through somehow

Yes the next step is love

Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me

We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins 'n that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right

Oh I've got a girl and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give

We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins 'n that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right

Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of

We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins 'n that'll make it all right
All right, all right, all right
We'll be kissin' cousins that'll make it all right

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Remember when
We never needed each other
The best of friends
Like sister and brother
We understood
We'd never be alone
Those days are gone
Now I want you so much
The night is long
And I need your touch
Don't know what to say
Never meant to feel this way
Don't wanna be
Alone tonight

What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall
In love with you?

I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child
That I resemble
I cannot pretend
That we can still be friends
Don't wanna be
Alone tonight

What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall
In love with you?

Oh, I wanna say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know, oh-oh
I don't wanna live this life
I don't wanna say goodbye
With you I wanna spend
The rest of my life

What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time
What did I say?
What did you do?
How did I fall
In love with you?
What can I do
To make you mine?
Falling so hard
So fast this time

Everything's changed
We never knew
How did I fall in love with you?

Money.
Money...
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money
So you go to church
Read the Holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the Just Few
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You'll do anything for money...

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cause your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You'll do anything for money...

All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say No, no
All or nothing at all

All or nothing at all

Sweeter than springtime
And the whisper of lilac, apple, pine and pear
Will fill the air

And one day

I done drank Codeine from a broken whiskey glass
I done popped my pills and I smoked my share of grass
Slaved for the man and I broke my fuckin' back
So you can take your nine-to-five and shove it up your ass
And I won't go on, like a highway to hell
Going too damn fast, I spilled drink on my Chanel
And I woke up and my room's fuckin' trashed like a damn hotel
Where I go next, now, only time will tell

I done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit
I done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget
Started callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist
They ain't never listened now I'm makin' them hits so I'm fuckin' your bitch
No it ain't nothin' fickle for me to forget that you ever exist
Bet you remember my name when I pull up and dab with that, doesn't exist, skrrr
Spill lean on supreme last Saturday, let that shit splash, motherfucker talk saucey
Pass me the drugs, motherfucker let me shine
At the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed
Smokin' my dope, beggin' that that be the code
Man, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old
Like it's been years since you been to the store
Feel like Meek Milly but I ain't from Philly
I'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grillie
I do this for really and for my family
Some shade every night, man, it's all so familiar
The bitches they killin' me
Like, bitch are you kiddin' me?
Ballin', that shit, that shit killin' me
You can't get rid of me
Now you want my chain and my jeans but you no good at chemistry

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading too fast?
How do you lose yourself to someone?
And never lose your ways
How do you not run out of new things to say?
And since we're always changing
How can it be the same?
And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear his name
I know the way I feel for you
It's now or never
The more I love the more that L'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever
Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose
The music never ends

I know the way I feel for you
It's now or never!
(How do you keep the music playing?)
The more I love the more that I'm afraid
(How do you make it last)
That in your eyes I may not see forever
Forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with everyday to make it better as it grows
With any luck, then I suppose

With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I don't have a clue at all
Oh yeah

And I'm sinking, you're wading
Well, I'm thinking something's gotta give

Wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta-

Maybe I'm just a waste
Filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on the last paycheck
I'm a cliche in a song
And everybody's singing along

Well, I'm sinking, you're wading
Well, I'm thinking something's gotta give

Wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

Someone please come pull me out
From the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up, I'm falling

Wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

You wouldn't let me anyway

For the longest while
I forgot to smile
Then I met you
Now that my blue days have passed
Now that I've found you at last

I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you've planned
Need a helping hand
I will understand
Always, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year
But always

Dreams will all come true
Growing old with you
And time will fly
Caring each day more
Than the day before
Till spring rolls by
Then when the springtme has gone
Then will my love linger on

Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with

In your city faded off the brown, Nino

Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Who'd have thought a country-wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list

If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothing
Now it's super bad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
Um, you're such a fucking loser
He ain't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac

Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target

And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention

Nuts they go, Macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth truth-spilling
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback motherfucker for the way that you got at me how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out of your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place

For being scared, no
'Bout a novel long all the pain that he's caused you
Baby I'm fully aware, I'm fully aware
If I could change the story's ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending of what to do

I could be the one
Give you all the love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free

And refill the better half

There's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go?
I'll take it slow
'Cause there's no need to rush
When I know

I could be the one
Give you all the love

I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

With you I'm not a little girl, with you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious, you see that I am weak
You see that I am silly, and pretentious and a freak

But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus:]
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
Your love has given me hope
Rescue me (rescue me, it's hard to believe)
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope

With you I'm not a fascist, can't play you like a toy
And when I need to dominate, you're not my little boy
You see that I am hungry for a life of understanding
And you forgive my angry little heart when she's demanding
You bring me to my knees while I'm scratching out the eyes
Of a world I want to conquer, and deliver, and despise
And right while I am kneeling there
I suddenly begin to care
And understand that there could be
A person that loves me

[Chorus]

Love is understanding
Its hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an s.o.s.
Stop me from drowning baby I'll do the rest

Rescue me [echo]
Your love has given me hope (your love has given me hope)
Rescue me [echo]
I'm drowning, baby throw out your rope (baby throw out your rope)
[repeat]

Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding
Ooh ahh, ooh ahh, love is understanding

Love is understanding
It's hard to believe life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an s.o.s.
Rescue me, rescue me

It's not my business to decide
How good you are for me
How valuable you are
And what the world can see
Only that you try to understand me
And have the courage to love me for me

[background vocals, continuously for remainder of song:]
I believe in the power, I believe you can rescue me

I believe (I believe in the power)
I believe that you can rescue me
[repeat]

I'm singing I believe
I believe that you can rescue me
I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me

I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
[repeat]

I'm singing, I'm singing, I believe
I believe that you can rescue me

Hey hey, hey hey

Only you can rescue me
Hey hey, hey...

Make someone happy,
Make just one someone happy.
Make just one heart the heart you sing to.
One smile that cheers you,
One face that lights when it nears you.
One gal you're everything to.

Fame, if you win it,
Comes and goes in a minute.
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer,
Someone to love is the answer.

Once you've found her,
Build your world around her.
Make someone happy.
Make just one someone happy
And you will be happy too.

Why you always gotta smack a whore? (Huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (Huh?)
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, 'Walk on Water' sucks
Bitch, suck my dick!

'Fore you heard it, so you formed your verdict
While you sat with your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs (Chill!)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (Wait, Em!)
But nowadays every flow, every cadence sound the same (Skrrt)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why

To How can I be down?, all of us tryna pile in the car (Yeah!)
We shot for the stars (Yeah!)

So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (Yeah!)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (Woo!)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
Well, I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
And when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at?
What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyonc√© this and Kehlani that (Yeah!)
I just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em

And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like‚Äî

Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, oh, when we're kissing, yeah
Feel so different, yeah.
Baby, tell me how did you get so...

Cold enough to chill my bones?
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, but where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space

Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones?

Just give me a pen and I‚Äôll write my worries
Now and again I‚Äôll try and not see that you don‚Äôt care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life‚Äôs bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don‚Äôt care

And hey, I don‚Äôt speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

They‚Äôve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don‚Äôt care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don‚Äôt care

And hey, I don‚Äôt speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniffin', pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner tryin' to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms, so fuck all of you!
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion, it's all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
'Cause I think I started hallucinating, 'cause I just thought I heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I could do was follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail-polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight, I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice, so I'm not as deluded
'Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi, but that hoochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
Butt juicier, ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth-waterin' too
So I walked over to her, like, I'm Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll introduce ya
Oh, I'm a misogynist too, but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth, uh!
Chronic abuser, and I don't mean a user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a Ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood, so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke, I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, I'm fuckin' stoned like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of reusable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
That were placed next to Veronica's boobs
And the paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for him

Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen to me

Thought I'd give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps, relapsing under that
Well, that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like it's a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
'Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked and coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled, had some struggles, yeah
But that passion and hunger's back
What a fantastic juggling act!
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics, but in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped a duffel bag to my back
And stuffed a massive punchin' bag in it
And an elastic bungee strap, rubber, plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back
Latch on a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snap the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, utter my last rebuttal
And just as I'm to come crashin'
I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress and ceramic construction hat
Rub my magic mushroom tat
For luck, then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up, then gasp, lungs collapsed
And that's more likely than finding someone that's‚Ä¶

Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me
Don't laugh, please listen to me

Couple of shots of J√§ger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
You're top ten, ain't you?
Stop it, you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting, you're not even up in that conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless
Whatever your job is, I give a fuck what's your occupation
You're thinkin' just 'cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
If you dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles, bacon
A fuckin' McDonald's egg and cheese sausage bagel finagled it
Flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way, then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Dr. Dre, so then what is it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation?!
(Aftermath) Still running hip-hop amazin'
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption, here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
'Til I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come
Before I finally stumble upon some lady that's‚Ä¶

Right for me, (that will) change me
Rearrange my head to be

As for compensation, there's a little he will ask
Take a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.

Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind 
To find the man in me.

But, oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
It sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.

The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine
Take a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.

Kiss a little, fishing for your lover
Won't you bring it down home to me

See a sky lit on fire, seen the dog in here
She lift her lips, with a passion, in the third degree
See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for the daddy all, when she does her thing

You can see the love, like check an ounce for pain
Darling won't you wanna
Sorry to resent, you said; gimme back
Keep your teeth
Never wanna hold you
Never wanna kiss you
I bet she's taking away from me
Never will repeat it, or never reprimand it
Will you bring it back home to me

Take care before my baby
When your baby gives it up for free
She just puts around, being lazy
But since she brings her lover to me
Don't need nothing to save me, say for a piece of your luxury

Honey, you better open your eyes
Look out

See a real long fire, she's the dog in here

See a dirty old lady, with a schoolgirl's grin
Break a back for her daddy, when she does her thing

Can't take care before my baby
When your baby gives it up for free
She just gets around being lazy
Until she brings her loving to me
I don't need nothing to save me
Say for a piece of your luxury
Lock the door, but you'll never gage me

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
Now, if you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill
You can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat, show him out
Just look him in the eye and simply shout

Enough is enough
I can't go on no more, no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now
Enough is enough

Too many people going underground,
Too many reaching for a piece of cake.
Too many people pulled and pushed around,
Too many waiting for that lucky break.

That was your first mistake,
You took your lucky break and broke it in two.
Now what can be done for you?
You broke it in two.

Too many people sharing party lines,
Too many people never sleeping late.
Too many people paying parking fines,
Too many hungry people losing weight.

That was your first mistake,
You took your lucky break and broke it in two.
Now what can be done for you?

Uh!

Too many people preaching practices,
Don't let 'em tell you what you wanna be.
Too many people holding back,
This is crazy, and baby, it's not like me.

That was your last mistake,
I find my love awake and waiting to be.
Now what can be done for you?

[Lyckety Splyt:]
This guy's a choke artist, ya catch a bad one
You're better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbing up this mountain, you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek

You ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you're the new kid on the block
'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fucking Nazi, your squad ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music

Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you looking foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
'Cause you follow Future like he got carrots up his ass crack
And when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turning in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

[B-Rabbit:]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies

Talkin' 'bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race

He can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly
Lickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'ma turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile

The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss, a whisper of love
I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity

This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew, but I was living in vain
She called my house
She said, You know my name,
And don't you pretend you never did me before.
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous.
The girl is so dangerous.
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind.
It's a passion in my soul,
But you're no damn lover friend of mine.

I cannot sleep alone at night.
My baby left me here tonight.
I cannot cope 'til it's all right.
You and your manipulation.
You hurt my baby.

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of a strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine

I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

Da da, da da, da da da

I'll give you all the love I want in return
But half a love is all I feel, sweet darling
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me anymore
But I'm going to change your mind
Some way, somehow

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

One way love is just a fantasy
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life
Oh baby, don't you want to care
Isn't it lonely out there

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

I want you the right way
I want you, but I want you to want me too
Want me baby, just like I want you

When sunny gets blue,
Her eyes get grey and cloudy,
Then the rain begins to fall.
Pitter, patter,
Pitter patter,
Love has gone, what can matter?
No sweet lover man comes to call.
When sunny gets blue
She breathes a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violins are playing
Weird and haunting melodies
People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got a name
Since that sad affair
She lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same
Memories will fade
And pretty dreams will rise
Up where her other dreams fell through
Hurry new love, hurry dear
To kiss away each lonely tear
And hold me near
'Cause sunny is blue . ..

Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder

What chance did I have
With the silver moon
Hanging in the sky
Opening old wounds

Taking hold of the hem of your dress
Cleanliness only comes in small doses
Bodily whole but my head's in a mess
Fuelling obsession that borders psychosis

It's a sad disease
Creeping through my mind
Causing disabilities
Of the strangest kind

Getting lost in the folds of your skirt
There's a price that I pay for my mission
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt
How I suffer the sweetest condition

Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder

[Verse 1:]
I'm just a thug, on the other side of the law
Raised in the hood, never thought I'd make it this far
I went from standing on the block
Dealing, toting my glock, weighing product on a triple-beam
I even got hassled a lot
Mainly by crooked cops
Life wasn't as easy as it seems

[Chorus:]
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])

[Verse 2:]
Gets harder everyday
To come up with the rent and ain't got a job
Trying to keep the bills paid
But don't wanna get locked up no more
See, my parole officer almost caught me with that stuff
Tossed it so he wouldn't find a trace
Not to mention my baby momma, the bitch is greedy as fuck
Got child support steady on my case

[Chorus:]
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])

[Verse 3:]
Got a little personal, but let me break it down
I'm not the only one out here going through it now
It's international, recessions all around
We gotta be here for each other when it hit the ground
I know you heard it, and work it
Don't give up it'll all work out
Can't never stop hoping, for certain
I be grinding until the day that I die

[Chorus:]
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])
Just trying to make it in the city
Where we stay on the grind (stay on the grind [x3])

He is pleased with me!
My Lord and Master
Declares that he's pleased with me-
What does he mean?
What does he know of me,
This lord and master?
When he has looked at me,
What has he seen?
Something young
Soft and slim,
Painted cheek,
Tap'ring limb,
Smiling lips
All for him,
Eyes that shine
Just for him-
So he thinks...
Just for him!
Though the man may be
My Lord and Master,
Though he may study me
As hard as he can,
The smile beneath my smile
He'll never see
He'll never know
I love another man
He'll never know
I love another man.

Love in the afternoon
Love in the afternoon
Hum...
He walked right up and told me
That he liked my style
I noticed  something  different
In the way he smiled
He said you're quite a lady
And I know a place that's shady
Would you care to come
And lie with me a while
And deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river
And he showed me the way
To find love in the afternoon
(Love in the afternoon)
Mmm...
(Love in the afternoon)
I knew he was a stranger
But I didn't care
We had something in common
But it wasn't clear
You said that life's a lover
When you're loving like no other
Don't you think it's time
For you to get your share
And deep in my soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And  found  that  sweet  old  river
And he showed me the way
(Showed me the way)
To find  love in the afternoon
(Love in the afternoon, hum...
Love in the afternoon)
I never  could  remember
Or recall his name
But I hang on to that memory
Just  the  same
You  know  it  makes  me  crazy
It makes my head all hazy
To think about the way he play that game
Cause deep in my soul
(Deep in my soul)
I could feel a quiver
(I could feel a quiver)
When he went down
And found that sweet old river
And he showed me the way
(Showed me the way)
To find love in the afternoon
(Love in the afternoon)
(Afternoon... ah...)
Yes,  deep  in  my  soul
I could feel a quiver
When he went down
And found that sweet old river
And he showed me the way to find...
Showed me and showed me
And showed me the way to find
Love in the afternoon
(Love in the afternoon)
Mmm...Mmm...

Feeling far above par, oh how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me

So, on and on it will always be

For you and I have a guardian angel on high
With nothing to do but to give to you
And to give to me love forever true

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinking I'm heartless
I know you're thinking I'm cold
I'm just protecting my innocence
I'm just protecting my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No
No, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)

'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Everybody knows:
One day we love each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time.

When I was young and just getting started,
And people talked to me: they sounded broken hearted.
Then I grew up and got my imagination,
And all I wanted was to start a new relation.

So in love, but love had a bad reaction.
I was looking for some good old satisfaction,
But pain is all I got
When all I needed was some love and affection.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain and pleasure.
Pain and pleasure.

When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light,
But inside of your mind you put up a fight.

Where are the answers that we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore.
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad,
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad.

Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better, for worse.
So let's make the best of the rest of our years.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
I told you so.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain and pleasure.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

All your life.
Pain, pleasure.

Funny day
Looking for laughter
And finding it there
Sunny day
Braiding wild flowers
And leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil
And wrote I LOVE YOU
In my finest hand
Wanted to send it
But I don't know
Where I stand
Telephone
Even the sound of your voice
Is still new
All alone in California
I'm talking to you
I'm feeling too foolish and strange
To say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early
Cause I don't know
Where I stand
Doo-doo-doo-ooh
Crickets call
Courting the ladies
In starred apple green
Thicket's tall
Until the morning
Comes up like a dream
How muted and misty
Such rouse
And I'll take
What sleep I can
I know that I miss you
But I don't know
Where I stand
I know that I miss you
But I don't know
Where I stand

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave

Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forevermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty four?
Ho!

I guess you could consider it poetry, but with me it started out with just words, just words.
They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases.
By this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals, psychopathical killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer)

Feelin' it in the air, hanging in the night
Staring at the full moon
Did you ever think we would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in the class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off
Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick tot
To my inner enemy in a rush
I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams
With anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun
I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard
Every award show, we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical
To a kid that wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?
Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit
Before me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit
We put the world onto us so watch how you say fuck me
You just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time
I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity
And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller
Knowing nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

This elite drinker, is a ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher
With a street sweeper full of heat seekers
In your Jeep speakers I'm a keep ringers
I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Niggas try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R
Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word
Making work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the traffic blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?
Money like Dracula, has him a spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexing?
Fuck yes with the goon talk
I just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street
CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller
Knowing nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

Feelin' it in the air, hanging in the night
Staring at the full moon
Did you ever think we would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

The thought of retiring
Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron
What up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
I'm hopin' to fill up your opening
Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and
You've probably already been with all the slaughter and iron men
No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
With no strings attached
I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein' brought up so brought up inspired
But I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool
Not an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talkin', the twine like a bean's talkin' and buyin'
But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause
In the fabric of our modern society
Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Dammit the pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin
Singin' Bagpipes from Baghdad again
In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in, a glad bag
Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance, like that again
You thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again?
I've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I've thought of another fucking line
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak
Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin' to sneak by it
While his feet stomp follow me while I revive rap
I'm a start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
Boston, across the marathon finish line and I
Put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar
And I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife
A saberless Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight
With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
Perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all and just ride
Like I'm locked up inside a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car
Uncle Ronnie is driving, 'bout to burst in through the side door
Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller
Knowing nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

[Intro]
SLIM!
HI MY NAME IS...
...Bitch you make me hurl. 

[Verse 1]
They call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out, won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife, what you Mariah, fly through twice...

[Pre-Chorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I love these ho's
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what, that's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I, I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you...

[Pre-Chorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

Cause, I know you want me baby, I think I want you too (Cry me a River, Cry me a River-er)
I think I love you baby, I think I love you too (Cry me a River)
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River-er)
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too (Cry me a River)
They call me superman, I'm here to rescue you (Cry me a River-er)
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River)
Ooooh boy you drive me crazy, bitch you make me hurl... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
First thing you say, I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyways
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh ya' girl run that game
Hallie Jade, I love that name, love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces, uh, that's great.
First off you don't know Marshall, at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that barstool
There goes another lawsuit, leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax, and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans...

[Pre-Chorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

[Chorus B]
Cause, I know you want me baby, I think I want you too (Cry me a River, Cry me a River-er)
I think I love you baby, I think I love you too (Cry me a River)
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River-er)
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too(Cry me a River)
They call me superman, I'm here to rescue you (Cry me a River-er)
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River)
Ooooh boy you drive me crazy, bitch you make me hurl... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

Cause I can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman 
Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River-er)
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)

Shawty got a body that jeans can't hold
And she moving like she learned everything from the pole
And she loves to party, number one hobby
Out 'til the morning, better ask somebody
Talk to the girl while he's around
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She's a girl from the future
Says she's sick and tired of the old
So all that old shit can hit the road
Man, you only know if you know
'Cause she's

What's up with it?

Seen her at Laser and she stopped and posed
When she see the green one, she just go, go, go
Like a stolen Bugatti, got money in your pocket
That makes you a Willy Parker pop up when he got a body
Talk to the girl while he's around
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She says you must have money in your wallet 'til the thing don't fold
Unless his credit card's black, not gold
Now you only know if you know
For real

She fuck me like she know me, then fuck me like she owe me
She told me, then she showed me, then she cuddled like she lonely
All for the love of the Holy Matrimony
But I'm pretty like Tony, and I'm pimping like Goldie
How you doing? I'm the motherfucking man
True hot boy, catch me running with the flame
She a hot girl, so she running with the name
Drop, drop it like it's hot, on my motherfucking thing
Mami like a lotta, Papi like the Murcielago
Grada, riding down Mercer
Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh
If you let me menage, I'll take you to see Usher

[Usher:]
Talk to the girl while he's around (gotta talk to her, man)
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound (hey, when she hear that sound)
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground (shake it up, let me see you drop down low)
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She said, It don't really take too much to get me out of control
Maybe you the star, but this my show
Just take a little and I'm good to go
Yeah, man
You fucking with a

Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a hot thing)
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing

Dying on a train.
No more destination,
No more pain.
Well, he said
One thing before I graduate
Never let your fear decide your fate.

Fly, fly, baby don't cry.
No need to worry cause
Everybody will die.

Go, go, baby don't go.
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know.

Leave us all behind.

But just for tonight
Hold on

So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we rage
Against the dying of the light

Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much

Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool

In the heat of the summer
I remember the ways you looked at me
Said you wish I was older
You had a thing for 1983
I was born a believer
I believe in the way you called to me
Like a dance hall choir
Singing out in broken revelry

Hey!
I really wanna see you again but I'm thinking
Hey!
It's hard for me to just be a friend

You do something to me
That I can't explain away
You're killing me with chemistry
All these words in my head
That I probably shouldn't say
But I'll say them anyway
You're killing me with chemistry
(You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry)

You had love for the mixtape
With your feet on the dashboard of my car
You said you couldn't remember
The last time you heard your favorite song
We sang it out for the sinners
Slowly passing by out on the road
With your hand on my hand
Said I know a place that we can go

Hey!
I really wanna go there again but I'm thinking
Hey!
You know we never go there as friends

Honey, you do something to me
That I can't explain away
You're killing me with chemistry
All these words in my head
That I probably shouldn't say
But I'll say them anyway
You're killing me with chemistry
(You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry)
You're killing me with chemistry

I don't know why
But you just fit right
I don't know why
But you just fit right

You do something to me
That I can't explain away
You're killing me with chemistry
All these words in my head
That I probably shouldn't say
But I'll say them anyway
You're killing me with chemistry

(You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry)
You're killing me with chemistry
(You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry
You're killing me with chemistry)
You're killing me with chemistry

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumi√®re, darling
Lumi√®re over me

Lumi√®re, darling
Lumi√®re over me

Lumi√®re, darling
Lumi√®re over me

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that

It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back

You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
'Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

You brought me faith, and hope, and love, and light

With your tender smile
You brought me to the promise
Of life outside a world of nine-to-five and Sunday
Ooh, I didn't know how rich I could be
Ooh, Until you gave, you gave your love to me, baby
You light up my life
You give me faith, and hope, and love, and light

You brought your sweet understanding
Like sunrays in my hazy sky
If you hadn't opened up my eyes
Love would have passed me right on by, right on by

Oh baby, you light up my life like sunshine in the morning
You make me believe that anything, anything is possible
Mmm, I never knew how good I could feel
Loving you's left me with nothing to conceal baby

You really light up my life
You give me faith, and hope, and love, and light

Yo, why the fuck these little bitches always talking shit about what they did and...?
I don't give a fuck, bitch!
Nicki Lewinsky
Look (fucker!)

When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
Nick-Nack, Carry Crack, what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker, I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJs
I tell a bitch this: I'm not impressed, bitch
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars

Late-night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your garbage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

See, see, you see Anna Mae?
I'm about to slap ya'll bitches 'round and call ya'll Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, real talk, like
'Cause, you know, this is '08 now, like
So, anything you talk about, like, it gotta be, it gotta be, at least, within a two-year radius type shit, like

Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams
Funny but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

[Sample - Rock Therapy Reaching Out:]
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?

[Eminem:]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

Aunt Edna always told me Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...

[Sample - Rock Therapy Reaching Out:]
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
So oh oh

[Eminem:]
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong.
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
So...

Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now I feel invisible to you, like I'm not real

Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say

I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

Am I just some chick you place beside you to take somebody's place?
When you turn around can you recognize my face?

You used to love me, you used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't OK

I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip
And I'm in this thing alone

Crying out loud
I'm crying out loud
Crying out loud
I'm crying out loud

Open your eyes
Open up wide

Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why should I care?
If you don't care
Then I don't care
We're not going anywhere

Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone

Why should I care?
If you don't care

You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us

Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now?

Hard to look at pictures on the wall
Hard to pick the phone up when you call
Hardly talking any more 'cause a single word could start a war
Once upon a time we had it all

Who would've known the future wasn't for us
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lean on love
But look at us now
Look at us now

How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart
Can't put my finger on the when, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark
Ya know it killing to me say it out loud
Woo
Look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

Back to back, we sleep on separate sides
Back and forth we slowly lose our minds
Backing out the driveway feels like this goodbye could be for real
Once upon a time time was on our side

Who would've known the future wasn't for us
Fools - we got it wrong, so wrong

How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart
Can't put my finger on the when, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in dark
Ya know it's killing me to say it out loud
Woo
Look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground
And you can't even look at me now
Ooh baby
Look at us now

Who would've known the future wasn't for us
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we'd lean on love
But look at us now
Look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

Little boy lost
In search
Of little boy found
You go on wondering, wandering
Stumbling, tumbling
'Round. . .  'round. . .
When will you find
What's on the tip of your mind
Mmm...Why are you blind
To all you ever were
Never were
Really are
Nearly are
Little boy  false
In search
Of little boy true
Will you be ever done
Traveling
Always unraveling
You, . . you. . .
Running  away
Could leave you farther astray
And as for fishing in streams
For pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit
What is the sense of it
Little boy blue
Don't  let  your little sheep roam
It's time come blow  your  horn
Meet them on
Look and see
Can you be far from home...

This is for the little girls
That say Nicki, you pretty.
When you come to the city
You don't act hassadiddy
You be all on the block
Or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band
Whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up
And don't come to the hood
How they turn their nose up
Like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight
'Til it's time for picture
That's why everything
They write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bugs
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid
That can't do no more

This is for my lil homies
That be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes
They be passing they digits
Carry up on the block
Getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school, getting off
Whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough
Might break in your jaw
They'll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know
They airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter
They can't turn no dodge
No matter the squadron
Lieutenant or sergeant
Air force the army
Air force in army
Four teets is on 'em
No heat is on 'em
'Cause grandmama prayed
That he leave the corner

Thanks to the Messiah

One time for my niggas
That be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas
That be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls
That pushing they own ride
Specially they own life
Bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad
When I blaze the gun
I see you without a man
May I raise your son
But look, when you blow up
Everybody gon' shut up
This goes out to everybody
On the come up

Yo his wife worth more value than what he owns
To prove your love is his

When the music gets involved
(Aah ah)
And you can't seem to let go
(Ah)
And then the passion
(The passion)
Causes a reaction
(A reaction)
And your body loses control
Things starts to get swilly
(Ugh ah)
Wanting to remove your clothes
(Aah ugh)
And not caring where this goes
(Aah ugh)
It's just so hot inside
(Yeah yeah)
It's that feeling
That feeling in your soul yeah
It's called love
And it's a magic ride
C'mon and ride
Hey, this is not a love song
What's a guy gotta do
What's a guy gotta do
What's a guy gotta do
What's a guy gotta do
What's a guy gotta do
What's a guy gotta do

What's a guy gotta do
To come home with you
Yo his wife worth more value than what he owns
What's a guy gotta do
To prove your love is his

[Bizarre:]
Music, reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers
Have a responsibility to these kids... Psych!

[Eminem:]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, or show love? Or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down
Run myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park: five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shooting, I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch; let's see you freestyle!
Talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man, I hate this crap, this ain't rap
This is crazy, the way we act when we confuse hip-hop
With real life when the music stops

[Swifty McVay:]
Ain't no getting rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think, I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered; I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbours for acres
I'll murder you; I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of Sam; bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dying ‚Äì you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Kon Artis:]
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends
Turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Begging with their hands out
Checking for your record when it's selling
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think Damn! when you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow
Wonder would they even call? When the music stops

[Kuniva:]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you with a pistol
Sipping a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what? When lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddy-wagon
Bragging about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given the chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dying alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype, popping shit in broad daylight
Nigga, you're a goner at night; when the music stops

[Proof:]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark, like, Woof!
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop

[Bizarre:]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to Rock the Bells
NWA said Fuck the Police, now I'm in jail
Ninety-three was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson ‚Äì who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flying down Sunset, smoking crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose
And a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock
I'm reaching for the Glock, but the music stops

Too much for a man to take

You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
We're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover

When it all falls, when it all falls down

Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on

This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

5117,Eminem,,Kings Never Die(from Southpaw soundtrack),,"

[Gwen Stefani:]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Eminem (Gwen Stefani):]
I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
'Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)

[Eminem:]
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I on-line? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, 'cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
(It) just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

[Gwen Stefani:]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Eminem:]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

[Eminem:]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Eminem:]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that Soundbombing Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't

[Gwen Stefani:]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

And they came from the valleys and the plains
They struggled in the cold

Play their minds away

We're all summoned by a tune
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon...
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

From the west and the north and from the east
They waited for the man

Longed to hear him play
Play their minds away

We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon...
We're following the piper
And we dance beneath the moon for him
And we dance beneath the moon

He seduced everybody in the land
The fire in his eyes
And the fear was a weapon in his hand
So they let him play
Play their minds away

We're following the piper

And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play

And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round

You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure

Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of pleasure?

Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing

I fell in love
Once too often
She was the nail
In my coffin

Light me up like a flame
And put me out once again

When you lost your dignity
You can rip mine right out of me
You lift your life with tongue and cheek
And I lift mine afraid to speak

And I'm tired enough to break into
And I'm certain that the only reason is you
And with you the issue is if I rolled out a list
And set it out and read it out loud
Never be kissed again

I made my bed
And she lay in it first
She's like a rose
With her head trapped in the dirt

Cut me up
Get me in the mood
And put me back together
Like a Rubik's cube

And there's no love between these sheets
Just (brought these knots[?]) with itchy feet
And when you dig your claws in deep
My heart will break but I wont bleed

And I'm tired enough to break into
And I'm certain that the only reason is you
And with you the issue is if I rolled out a list...

All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
To make you change your mind

And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I didn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my day
Trying to find my way
Still these feelings that I felt
I said to you and no one else

And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet

That's called the blues

Don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it's what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore

I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I go I see you
You know it's what you planned, this much is true
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore

What this means to me
The more I know you believe
What I thought was you now
Has got more that it changed on you

What I thought was true
The more that I might know is you
What I thought was you
Is only memories, distant

I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation

So they fight and fight and fight
And no more kissin' kissin' goodnight

Ain't no way we'll ever get enough
It's the kind of sweet dreams are made of
I'm not afraid of
No super love

Some people they never find out
How it feels to be feelin' no doubt
You'll be right there when I fall
And I'll be promisin' you the world
No getting down on your knees

Trying to get what ya need
It's a good situation
Sorry for elaboratin'
But I want more and more and more
So just keep knockin' knockin' knockin' on my door
But baby you're a hard thing to find
Because

Never gonna give give it up

And alone in the world
Walk with me
In the gentle rain
Don't be afraid, I've a hand
For your hand and I
Will be your love for a while

I feel your tears as they fall
On my cheek
They are warm like gentle rain
Come little one you have me in the
World and our love will be sweet
Very sweet

Our love will
Be sweet very sad
Very sweet like gentle rain

And these little things define you forever, forever

All this bad blood here
Won‚Äôt you let it dry?

Won‚Äôt you let it lie?

If we‚Äôre only ever looking back
We will drive ourselves insane
As the friendship goes resentment grows
We will walk our different ways

But those are the days that bind us together, forever
And those little things define us forever, forever

3044,Bob Dylan,,Caribbean Wind,,"

She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy

Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which
From one to another she could easily switch
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire

She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know he's got our best interest in mind
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind

The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed
Street band playing Nearer My God to Thee
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said, I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire

Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, Daddy, I always think it's for me
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls

Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be movin' on
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire

From too much talk to silent touches
Sweet touches
We turned our hearts to love then tried it
First time romance
There in the quiet
Love learns to dance

We loved, we slept, we left the light on
The night's gone
And morning finds us caught in life's most
Sensible trance
Turn up the quiet
Love wants to dance

Old souls find new life
In hearts that are listening like ours
And old dreams find young wings
In silence, in silence

From too much talk to loving touches
Love touches
When pure emotion takes the moment
We take the chance
Turn up the quiet
Love wants to dance
Love wants to dance

But it takes a stronger man to walk away
Than to watch our love fade away

I did not cheat, I did not lie
I hope you know how hard I tried

When did lust for you become an organized crime?
I tried to keep you honest, babe, but I was just a pawn
You played the part so well, it hurts to know you're gone

Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
Like you planned it, you're a bandit.
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal.

Let me count the ways; I six, seven, ate my words
Right from your silver plate, we checked in, checked out, checkmate
I couldn't keep you honest, babe, 'cause I was just a card you played
The draw so well, it hurts to know you're gone, you're gone, you're gone

Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?
Did you fake it just to break another stranger in your bed?
Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel

But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away
And nothing is for real

When I'm with you I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently I pray

Helpless and hopeless
That's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible
If God is on my side

When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away
And nothing is for real

I'll go anywhere
And do anything
Just to touch your face
There's no mountain high
I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless

That love is...

No place left to hide
Too powerful to fast
To keep it inside

Everything's so new,
So innocent, so true
We're reaching for that star,
'Cause darling, here we are

[Dan:] Well, it's been a while since anybody asked me that.

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
There's a hollow in me now

It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallow every single word
And every whisper, every sigh eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
If you giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me..

But if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes,
does it almost feel like you've been here before?

How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

If you close your eyes,

Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation

No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's OK! [*fart sound*]

You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking

Living piggy lives

For A Better Moment That Didn't Come.
There Never Could Be A Better Moment
Than This One, This One.

The Swan Is Gliding Above The Ocean,
A God Is Riding Upon His Back,
How Calm The Water And Bright The Rainbow
Fade This Swan To Black.

What Opportunities Did We Allow To Flow By
Feeling Like Like The Timing Wasn't Quite Right?
What Kind Of Magic Might Have Worked If We Had Stayed Calm,
Couldn't I Have Given You A Better Life?

Did You Ever Take Me In Your Arms,
Look Me In The Eye, Tell Me That You Do?
Did I Ever Open Up My Heart,
Let You Look Inside?

If I Never Did It, I Was Only Waiting
For A Better Moment That Didn't Come.
There Never Could Be A Better Moment
Than This One, This One.

The Swan Is Gliding Above The Ocean,
A God Is Riding Upon His Back,
How Calm The Water And Bright The Rainbow
Fade This Swan To Black.

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times I must not be so oh oh oh
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Do do do do do
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P.C. Thirty-One said We caught a dirty one
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Do do do do do
Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Wow wow wow oh!
Do do do do do

Silver hammer Max

Sweet Angeline I loved you much more than poets say in rhyme
Just for one short time

Sweet Angeline remember though we've not seen the summer through
I lived only for you
I'm only human and I realize it's no use trying to disguise
My love for you Angeline has ended
So let's be thankful now not sad
For the little love we've had

Honey, honey, can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
Oh, won't you please let me
Because they get to me
They touch me and then move me
I get to thinking I won't be needin'
Anything more to keep me warm
I feel the feeling of you
Al1 the way through
No other feeling will ever do
Honey, honey,
Can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
They're just like old friends
When we're together
They comfort me and soothe me
They're not brand new
They're a little worn through,
But they're comfy and roomy
They do something to me
And when I stay at home
And you're far away
I won' t be lonely all through the day
Honey, honey,
Can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you
I feel the feeling of you
All the day through
No other feeling will ever do
Honey, honey,
Can I put on your clothes?
Because they feel so good
And they feel like you...

Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed Fuck the world
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ah, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady

Remove the chains of darkness let me see, Lord let me see

You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out

Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down

A face like heaven catching lightning in your nightgown,
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

Ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am

You were my voice when I couldn't speak

Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be

We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
Been watching our castle turning into dust
Escaping our shadows just to end up here once more
And we both know

This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time

Broken smile, tired eyes
I can feel your longing heart
Call my name, howling from afar

We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat
Been building our castle just to watch it fall
Been running forever just to end up here once more
And now we know

This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time

Take me back
Back to the mountainside
Under the northern lights
Chasing the stars

Take me back
Back to the mountainside
When we were full of life
Back to the start
We both know that

This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time

In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick‚Äîthis dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
'Cause I got jelly, like Beyonc√©'s potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain because of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then‚Äî

I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: don't coax me

It's a critical solution, and the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion, like the lies they sell to you

You got a glass-jawed toothache of a mental disease
And they be running 'round back, see them line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss-ass sycophants, throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go, watch them come in off the streets
While they're banging out front inside they're slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screaming bunch
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs, they're everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's ever supposed to learn

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll

I read it on a wall, it went straight to my head
It said, Dance to the tension of a world on edge
We got racial violence, and who'll cast the first stone?
And sex is used anyway it can be
Sometimes, when I look out, it's hard to see the day
It's a feeling, you can have it, it's not mine to take away

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
And there's no one who's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the Garden of Eden

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll
Suck on that

Looking through this point of view, there's no way I'm gonna fit in
No, you tell me what my eyes see, don't you tell me who to believe in
I ain't superstitious, but I know when something's wrong
I've been dragging my heels with a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
And there's no one who's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the Garden of Eden, come on

Oh yeah

Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous and out of control
The Garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said, if they had someone to buy it, said I'm sure they'd sell my soul

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
(And we ain't talkin' about no poison apple
Or some missin' rib, ya hear?)
Said, there's no one who's gonna believe this
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden

But there's nothing really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D-train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
Louise she's all right she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain ?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna they kept me up past the dawn.

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower frieze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, Jeeze
I can't find my knees.
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying, Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him.
But like Louise always says
Ya can't look at much, can ya man.

As she, herself prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm takin' a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind
Seen all those movie stars
And their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies, under the evergreens
But I know what I'm needin'
And I don't wanna waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind
It was so easy livin' day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times and the Daily News
Comes down to reality
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or up on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
I don't have any reasons
Cause left them all behind
I'm in a New York, I'm in a New York state of mind...

I got a new life
And I don't wanna go back
Never go back to where I was
God changed my way
Gave me a new heart
And I'll never be the same again
And you have my devotion forever
It's amazing that nothing would ever
Separate me from His love
My Creator from above

Who gave us life

Gave us life and that's why...

And you're not to blame, no
Now, I don't complain
And from my past show no shame, no
'Cause we all been down that road before
Hoping one day we will explore
What's behind the golden door
They say your friends ain't family
You're lost along the way, how can it be?
That you're here today and not tomorrow
Nothing is here for certain, yes, that breath you take is borrowed

You ain't seeing nothing because you already know
All about this business singing to you
You pray before you eat
You rock your Jesus piece, you're spiritual (spiritual)
You heard it all, you've seen it all, you know it all
You go to church sometimes or you heard the stories before (Oooh)
Well, that's all good, 'cause all I'm sug-sug-suggesting is that you get to know the Lord

The I.V. and your hospital bed

The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
It's not so pleasant.

I awake on a chilly Christmas morning
Watching choirs singing carols on TV
I gaze out through my window at a dozen other windows
Then I plug in my artificial tree
And like a dream I begin to remember every Christmas I used to know
A thousand miles away, a million years ago
I remember sky.
It was blue as ink,
Or at least I think
I remember sky
I remember snow, soft as feathers, sharp as thumbtacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint when the wind would blow
And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like strings and changing things
Like leaves
I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coatracks, spread like broken umbrellas
And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
Light and noise and bees and boys
And daaaaays, oh!
I remember days or at least I try
But as years go by, they're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink isn't really sky.
And at times I think I would gladly die
For a day of SKY!

No mountains too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh, yeah
No rivers too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

And then you will see the morning will come
And everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears‚Äîcast them on me
I just want you to see...

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

I saw your teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time
Seek me and you shall find
You have everything, and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day

And then you will see the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So, all of your fears‚Äîjust cast them on me
How can I make you see?

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive

And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the skies

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me

I reach for you girl and you're not there
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow
Still finding strings of your hair

Can we get back to love again?
Seems like I'm losing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again?
Can I make it up to you?
I promise that I'll do anything for us
'Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you

I don't wanna go on without you, baby
Don't wanna hurt anymore

Between the black and the white

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Unhappy faces behind a painted smile
Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style
Unhappy people living in sin and shame
Reflections of myself, life is no easy game
And we're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Young girls who'll soon become
Streetwalkers in the night
Young boys, the restless breed
Looking for a fight
Children both rich and poor
They're searching for the truth
And if they don't find it
God help tomorrow's youth
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Trade winds are blowing, blowing around me
While all around me what do I see
Hatred and jealousy
Brotherhood is dying
Love is the answer
Nobody's buying
Good people turning bad
Some don't but they are few
The winds are blowing
The choice is all up to you
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Yes we're caught up in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time
And we are riding on the trade winds
The trade wind of our time

We're caught up
Caught up in the trade winds, the trade winds of our time

We are riding
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

We're caught up
Caught up on the trade winds, the trade winds of our time

Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit (Yeah)
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like Go get 'em
And I'm just like Why you're tryin' to fight momentum?
We just keep winnin', by landslides, oh, and um
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say Our clothing line's on Fiyaa
Meanwhile, your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y, yes, sir!
So full of joy, boy, am I absurd?
Even Chingy would tell you: That boy don't curr

Listen, kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip your ass of your jewels right here
Man, I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man, you can catch a hot one like outta nowhere
A beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak, man, sometimes we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a sho nuff player
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

As I lay here with you
The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesn't matter

Though we may be the last in the world
We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears
To one another

And oh what a feeling
Inside of me
It might last for an hour
Wounds aren't healing
Inside of me
Though it feels good now
I know it's only for now

The feeling is intense
You grip me with your eyes
And then I realise
It doesn't matter

It was not a chance meeting
Feel my heart beating
You're the one
You could take all this, take it away
I'd still have it all
'Cause I've climbed the tree of life
And that is why, no longer scared if I fall

When I get lost in space
I can return to this place
'Cause, you're the one

Nothing fails
No more fears
Nothing fails
You washed away my tears
Nothing fails
No more fears

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me?
Yeah

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of running around
And I will do until I find myself with you and

Make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you'll never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

Could I lock in your love?

I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

They think we're not aware of their crimes
We know
But we're just not ready to act

The wind that's beginning to howl?

3806,Ed Sheeran,2011,Lately,EP: No. 5 Collaborations Project,"

[Ed:]
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
'Cause real will recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

[Devlin:]
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Chorus:]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

[Ed:]
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.

[Devlin:]
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

[Chorus:]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4]
The times I'm living in lately.

[Tarot Woman]

I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand say go go go

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know

Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

She can take you there
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my
Ride the carousel
Cast a magic spell, you can fly, fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know

High noon
Oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years' worth
Of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides
Why he's lighter than air
Oh I see his face

Where is your star
Is it far, is it far, is it far
When do we leave
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
So many die

We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why

Now where do we go

Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill

Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Strike him down

Power, power happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king
Strike him down

Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king, yeah
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah

Empty spaces.
What are we living for?
Abandoned places.
I guess we know the score.

On and on.
Does anybody know what we are looking for?

Another hero,
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain
In the pantomime.

Hold the line.
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
Inside my heart is breaking.
My make-up may be flaking.
But my smile still stays on.

Whatever happens,
I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache,
Another failed romance.

On and on.
Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm learning.
I must be warmer now.
I'll soon be turning
'Round the corner now.

Outside the dawn is breaking,
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
Inside my heart is breaking.
My make-up may be flaking,
But my smile still stays on.

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies.
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die.
I can fly, my friends.

Show must go on.
Show must go on.
I'll face it with a grin.
I'm never giving in‚Äî
Oh‚Äîwith the show.

I'll top the bill,

I have to find the will to carry on with the show.
On with the show.

3857,Ed Sheeran,2017,Eraser,√∑,"
_x000D_
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the lord's house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me, is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror, questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day, for someone like me
Without a nine to five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the route of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody want to see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and this should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm reverend run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now, somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Well save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My heart will stay the same

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love

In France when one is walking sadly
They say he walks Clopin Clopant
His step is slow, his fault is badly
Perhaps the one he loves is gone
Clopin Clopant I hear his footsteps
As in the night he passes by
And as I hear his endless footsteps
I get to thinking they'll go out
I'll go along Clopin Clopant
Whispering he's gone, he is gone, he is gone
My childish heart cries like a baby
Without my love what will each day be ?
So I go on Clopin Clopant
Trudging alone Clopin Clopant
Love is a dance and one must learn it
I had my chance, why did I spurn it?
What can I do? Why carry on?
Going alone Clopin Clopant, Clopin Clopant, Clopin Clopant...

From the fire in your words
To the dagger in your eye
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
I pretend to be asleep
But I know you hear me cry
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

But if I really want to change
Then I must admit
That I'm the one to blame

If I could breakaway
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could breakaway

Is it true what people say
That it's darkest before dawn?
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down
Any hope we might have saved
Is too weak to let live on
I just have to lay my body down
Go and lay my body down

And if I really want to change
Then tonight I'm gonna need
All of my strength

If I could breakaway
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could breakaway

Oh, anything is better than this
I know
Anything is better

If I could breakaway
Cut the cord
For worse or better
If I could turn the page
At last and say
Goodbye forever
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
If I could breakaway

If I could turn the page
But on the other side
Of yesterday
Beyond the heartache
What if all I am
Without the pain
Is empty heartache
I could break away

Thus all fairy stories end
Only an actress would pretend
Affairs of state are her latest play
Eight shows a week, two matinees
My how the worm begins to turn
When will the chorus girl ever learn?
My how the worm begins to turn
When will the chorus girl ever learn?

[Eva:]
The chorus girl hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
She won't go scrambling over the backs of the poor to be accepted
By making donations just large enough to the correct charity
She won't be president of your wonderful societies of philanthropy
Even if you asked her to be
As you should have asked her to be

The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
She won't join your clubs, she won't dance in your halls
She won't help the hungry once a month at your tombolas
She'll simply take control as you disappear

[Che:]
Forgive my intrusion, but fine as those sentiments sound
Little has changed for us peasants down here on the ground
I hate to sound childish, ungrateful, I don't like to moan
But do you now represent anyone's cause but your own?

Everything done will be justified by my foundation

And we still go on searching for each other

And love is right for us tonight

I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyes

Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart)
And in my mind? (in my mind)

I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

Strong winds of promise that will blow away all the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?

We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly

Still I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow

You're standing there with your cigarette
Looking at me like we've never met
I know I fucked up
So I'll take the blame
And I don't expect you, to let me explain
You can't forgive, I can't forget
I know you are just too different now

But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away
I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket
I let you get away
I let you get away
Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket
I let you get away
I let you get away

Now someone else is taking you home, yeah
Hands on the waist
I used to hold
And I know it's my fault
I'm late to the dance
Cause you couldn't wait for me and I understand
Why you never look back
Once that door closed
I know you are just too different now

But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away
I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket
I let you get away
I let you get away
Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket

Do you, do you still?

Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?

Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling
Maybe you're falling, but you're still alive
Ready yourself, that's quite enough of your bawlin'
'Cause baby, you're bawling, but you'll survive

Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

You can copy and paste your head on a new body
But that new body's still made of flesh
And cutting corners gets you where you're going
But how you get there is the real test

And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you

Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two

You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love

Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time we've learned to sail above
Time won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen

It's how the comedy ends
I'll have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friend
I'll try to apply myself
And teach my heart how to sing

I'll face the unknown
I'll build the world of my own
No one knows better than I myself
I'm by myself

Baby, you know that you're more than just a friend to me

You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach
A wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a

[Pre-Hook - Eminem:]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

[Hook - Skylar Grey:]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
The worst of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around her throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a... (shit)

[Verse 2 - Skylar Grey & Eminem:]
Sometimes I wish that you'd just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane

(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good
All you are to me

Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married?
Well Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside

When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[a medley of the songs Satan's Fall, Curse of the Pharaohs, A Corpse Without Soul, Into the Coven, Evil]

Satan's Fall
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall

Curse Of The Pharaohs
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

A Corpse Without Soul
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Into The Coven
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Evil
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry
And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind

There's an evening haze settling over town _x000D_
Starlight by the edge of the creek _x000D_
The buying power of the proletariat's gone down _x000D_
Money's getting shallow and weak _x000D_
Well, the place I love best is a sweet memory _x000D_
It's a new path that we trod _x000D_
They say low wages are a reality _x000D_
If we want to compete abroad 
_x000D_
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf _x000D_
Come sit down on my knee _x000D_
You are dearer to me than myself _x000D_
As you yourself can see _x000D_
While I'm listening to the steel rails hum _x000D_
Got both eyes tight shut _x000D_
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from _x000D_
Creeping it's way into my gut 
_x000D_
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind _x000D_
Bring me my boots and shoes _x000D_
You can hang back or fight your best on the frontline _x000D_
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues 
_x000D_
Well, I'm sailing on back, ready for the long haul _x000D_
Tossed by the winds and the seas _x000D_
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall _x000D_
I'll sell them to their enemies _x000D_
I'm trying to feed my soul with thought _x000D_
Going to sleep off the rest of the day _x000D_
Sometimes no one wants what we got _x000D_
Sometimes you can't give it away 
_x000D_
Now the place is ringed with countless foes _x000D_
Some of them may be deaf and dumb _x000D_
No man, no woman knows _x000D_
The hour that sorrow will come _x000D_
In the dark I hear the night birds call _x000D_
I can feel a lover's breath _x000D_
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall _x000D_
Sleep is like a temporary death 
_x000D_
Well, they burned my barn, and they stole my horse _x000D_
I can't save a dime _x000D_
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced _x000D_
Into a life of continual crime _x000D_
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking _x000D_
How I wish you were here to see _x000D_
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking _x000D_
That you have forgotten me? 
_x000D_
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret _x000D_
They waste your nights and days _x000D_
Them I will forget _x000D_
But you I'll remember always _x000D_
Old memories of you to me have clung _x000D_
You've wounded me with your words _x000D_
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue _x000D_
It's all true, everything you've heard 
_x000D_
In you, my friend, I find no blame _x000D_
Wanna look in my eyes, please do _x000D_
No one can ever claim _x000D_
That I took up arms against you _x000D_
All across the peaceful sacred fields _x000D_
They will lay you low _x000D_
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel _x000D_
I say it so it must be so 
_x000D_
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue _x000D_
Gonna give you another chance _x000D_
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you _x000D_
To lead me off in a cheerful dance _x000D_
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife _x000D_
I can live on rice and beans _x000D_

That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now

You're asking me will my love grow

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me, clowns
That means suicide, homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world, when you're the only one
With the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse
'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
I'm moppin' the floors with 'em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on
Droppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-
-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
If only I wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh

And I miss you, oh-oh

For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothin' that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'
This game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always
Proof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you
I never woulda came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you
Matter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, Naw, Doody, you're not!; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, Think of Hailie I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies; and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody

The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growin' older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And it don't stop, oh-oh
And it don't quit, oh-oh
And I miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh
I just miss you, oh-oh

Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of his hand is incredible
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
Keep a look out
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind you and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over

Ogre battle lives for ever more

After school walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass

And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun.

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun.

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me

Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles‚Äî.

You may see a stranger
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see him
Again and again

Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughin'
You may hear him laughin'
Across a crowded room
And night after night
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it?
Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons
Wise men never try

Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love
Across a crowded room
And fly to her side
And make her your own
For all through your life you
May dream all alone

Once you have found him
Never let her go
Once you have found him
Never let her go

To turn your dreams to a fact,

If you have the soul and the spirit
Never fear it, you'll see it through
Hearts can inspire other hearts, with their fire
For the strong obey
When a strong man shows them the way
Give me some men
Who are stout-hearted men
Who will fight for the right they adore
Start me with ten,
Who are stout-hearted men
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more

Shoulder to shoulder
And bolder and bolder
They grow as they go to the fore!

Then there's nothing in the world
Can halt or mar a plan
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man...

Constantly out of reach

When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile

Not I, says the referee
Don't point your finger at me
I could've stopped it in the eighth
An' maybe kept him from his fate
But the crowd would've booed, I'm sure
At not gettin' their money's worth
It's too bad he had to go
But there was a pressure on me too, you know
It wasn't me that made him fall
No, you can't blame me at all

Who killed Davey Moore
Why an' what's the reason for?

Not us, says the angry crowd
Whose screams filled the arena loud
It's too bad he died that night
But we just like to see a fight
We didn't mean for him t' meet his death
We just meant to see some sweat
There ain't nothing wrong in that
It wasn't us that made him fall
No, you can't blame us at all

Not me, says his manager
Puffing on a big cigar

But if he was sick, he should've said

With his ticket stub still in his hand

Anyway, I put money on him to win

No, you can't blame me at all

Who killed Davey Moore
Why an' what's the reason for?

Not me, says the boxing writer
Pounding print on his old typewriter
Sayin', Boxing ain't to blame
There's just as much danger in a football game
Sayin', Fistfighting is here to stay
It's just the old American way
It wasn't me that made him fall
No, you can't blame me at all

Who killed Davey Moore
Why an' what's the reason for?

Not me, says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cuba's door
Where boxing ain't allowed no more
I hit him, yes, it's true
But that's what I am paid to do
Don't say 'murder,' don't say 'kill'
It was destiny, it was God's will

Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?

Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
When I loved you
Nothing lived, nothing grew
Till I loved you

Or if the ground falls out beneath
I'll take a hold of all your colors
Until they start to bleed

Let the fantasy die

You dropped your love, now you're waiting on me

And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?'
Wow, well I'll show him who's really 'bad'
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop 'til I get enough'
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons
And I hope they all fucking die!
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him but I can't
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry

How fast do fast cars drive?
That's what I replied

We used to ride at night
We used to glide on the west side
But he fell and broke his spine
So I just left him behind

It rusted in the yard and now I'm sorry
I crashed my car so when I pull up to parties
I tell the girls my bike is a Ferrari

And how fast can you grow up
And are you grown up enough
To outgrow the things you love
And leave an old friend in the dust
Yeah I remember this one time
When I picked up my phone line
And I heard you on the other side
And you said C'mon let's ride

It rusted in the yard and now I'm sorry
I crashed my car so when I pull up to parties

That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan

There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no

Mama pyjama rolled outta bed
And she ran to the police station
When the Papa found out, he began to shout
He started the investigation

It was against the law, it was against the law
What my Mama saw, it was against the law

And the Mama looked down and she spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
And the Papa said Oy! if I get that boy
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
And I'm on my way, it's taking to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard

In a couple of days they're gonna take me away
When the press let the story leak
I have no reason, I have no reason
And we was all on the cover of Newsweek

Well I'm on my way, I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way, I'll take to town but I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie, queen of Corona
Seeing me and Julio down by the schoolyard

If I never met you
If I never saw your face
This world, this world would be a colder place, I bet.
If we'd never met...
If I never met you
If I never knew your love
My life, my life might be a sad song of regret.
If we'd never met...

But we said one Hello.
And look at how the world begins to spin
Look at how the shadows disappear
Now that you are here.

If I never met you
If I never felt your kiss
My days, my nights would not be filled like this, it's true.
I don't know who I'd love
I don't know what I'd do if I never met you.

Just look at how the shadows disappear
Now that you are here.
If I never met you
If I never felt your kiss
My days, my nights would be filled like this, it's true.
I don't know who I'd love
I don't know what I'd do
If I never met you.

I don't know who I'd love

_x000D_
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying.

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel the moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred.

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred.

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
And goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked.

And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you.

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you.

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to.

But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destiny
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in.

While some on principles baptize
To strict party platforms ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say God Bless him.

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in.

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.

Old lady judges, watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony.

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely.

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scoff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.

Your photograph's by my side
I know I can't forget you
So I don't even try

The note you left is in my hand
I read again what you say
You're sorry but you love him
And you've both gone away

This is the story of a man
Whose world has fallen apart
And it's the story
That is breaking my heart

An open fire, our favorite chair
I get a book from the shelf
But the words I am reading
Could apply to myself

This is the story of a man
Whose world has fallen apart
And it's the story
That is breaking my heart
Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart
Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart

[Chorus:]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazed

Dressed in black from head to toe
Two guitars across our backs
We would walk the city roads
Seeking someone who would listen to the music
That we were writing down at home.

[Chorus:]
But they can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through does early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy

Hair slicked back with vaseline
Like the pictures on the wall of the local record shop
Hearing noises we were destined to remember
We will the thrill to never stop

May sweet memories of friends from the past
Always comes to you, when you look for them
And your inspiration long may it last
May it come to you time and time again

Now everybody seems to have their own opinion
Of Who did this and who did that
But as for me I don't see how they can remember
When they weren't where it was at

[Chorus:]
They can't take it from me, if they tried
I lived through those early days
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter
Just to keep from getting crazy

I lived through those early days
I lived through those early days

Way up here with the northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One we've never reached

And you know we're sinking
We could fade away
I'm not going down

Too cold to see

Nosy cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating

It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayer to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years or grace
And it flatters me when I see
A smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love
(You showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care
(You showed me how to care)
And you showed me that
You will always (always) be there (be there)
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me (you showed me!)
When I was young just how to grow (to grow)
You showed me
Everything that I should to know

Just how to walk without your hands

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?

Summer night city
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free
Ah-ah

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park
Summer night city

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park

Midnight's prayers so softly whispered in
A cathedral's candle light
Bring the message of the holidays
On a snowy Christmas night

Holly reeds and hidden mistletoe
Symbols of the season's might
Joyful faces everywhere you go
On a snowy Christmas night

Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night

Mother Nature wears a bridal gown
For the world is dressed in white
There's a silent glow that fills the earth
On a snowy Christmas night

Give thanks for all you've been blessed with
And hold your loved ones tight
For you know the Lord's been good to you
On a snowy Christmas night

For you know the Lord's been good to you

Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there's some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did a lot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don't understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the 'burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don't really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don't understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn't ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me?
You know you're Harry and I'll always be Hermione

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart

Dear Wayne, I'm writing another letter 'cause
You never did respond, it's been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up, but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors?
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heaven's doors
Let's play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
'Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner?
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
(If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger)

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart

I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wayne
Said I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wayne
I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wayne
I'm wait, I'm waiting on Wa-a-a-a-a-a-ayne

Because I'm 16 going on the end of my days,
And if words aren't going to cut than I'll find another way.

Because I'm leaving what I know behind,
And I'm living out my chance to shine
Like the stars now fading from your eyes
And I hope you'll understand

Woah, woah, please wait till I come home
Woah, woah, don't turn my heart to stone.

Now the runway lights are fading,
With the darkness overtaking,
I'll leave you standing watching all alone
From that paneglass window one million miles away
And I'm sorry when I tell you
That I'm coming back someday

Because I'm leaving what I know behind,
And I'm living out my chance to shine
Like the stars now fading from your eyes
And I hope you'll understand

My dearest love who existed in a dream
Till this evening when a wave came and swept me out to sea
None of the loves that you have known
Could prepare you for the love raging everywhere in me
For all the arms that have covered you the hands
That have touched you and the lips
You have lingered on before
Added together would be less than an olive
In the banquet of love I have in store
Love season to entice
Love with all the trimmings filled with spice
Love flavored to your whim
Served piping hot with all the trimmings...Ooo...
For I'll decode every breath and every sigh
Till your every lover's wish
Is fulfilled before it's made
Toss in some jealousy and doubt
Should it be required
Not to rest till there's nothing more desired
Thus loving as I do
Never, never will you ever be untrue
Having love with all the trimmings
Waiting home for you...

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI

Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Stormzy:]
Check it
I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide, check it

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI‚Äîoh‚ÄîI

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Ed Sheeran & Stormzy:]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour up your liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
Baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I won't be talking on Twitter, girl, that is dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to C√®ilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

2389,Barbra Streisand,1983,A Piece Of Sky,soundtrack: Yentl,"

[Yentl reveals herself to Avigdor.
Though she is a woman ahead of her time, Avigdor is a prisoner of his.
So her journey  must continue... to a place where she hears things are different.]

Tell me where
Where is it written
What is it I meant to be?
That I can't dare...
It all began the day I found..
That from my window I could only see
A piece of sky.
I stepped outside and looked around.
I never dreamed it was so wide
Or even half as high.
The time had come
(Papa, can you hear me?)
To try my wings
(Papa, are you near me?)
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall,
I felt the most,
(Papa, can you see me?)
Amazing things,
(Can you understand me?)
The things you can't imagine
if you've never flown at all.
Though it's safer to stay on the ground,
Sometimes where danger lies
There the sweetest of pleasures are found.
No matter where I go,
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve,
But there will also be
More to question, yet more to believe..
Oh tell me where?
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?
And want to share
My ev'ry sweet-imagined possibility?
The more I live - the more I learn.
The more I learn - the more I realize
The less I know.
Each step I take -
(Papa, I've a voice now!)Each page I turn -
(Papa, I've a choice now!)Each mile I travel only means
The more I have to go.
What's wrong with wanting more?
If you can fly - then soar!
With all there is - why settle for
just a piece of sky?
Papa, I can hear you...
Papa, I can see you...
Papa, I can feel you...
Papa, watch me fly!

If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If you're looking for trouble
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
Because I'm evil, my middle name is misery
Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me

I've never looked for trouble
But I've never ran
I don't take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out
Of flesh, blood and bone
But if you're gonna start a rumble
Don't you try it on alone
Because I'm evil, my middle name is misery
Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me
I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be
I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be
So don't mess around don't mess around don't mess around with me
I'm evil, I'm evil, evil, evil
So don't mess around, don't mess around with me
I'm evil, I tell you I'm evil
So don't mess around with me
Yeah!

Self-contained and self-content
No promises to keep
I've got things so together
That I just can't fall asleep
Walked the night and drank the moon
Got home at half past four
And I knew that no one marked my time
As I unlocked my door
It's really lovely to discover
That you like to be alone
Not to owe your man an answer
When he gets you on the phone
Not to share a pair of pork chops
When you crave champagne and cheese
And your aim becomes to please yourself
And not to aim to please
Oh they sold me when they told me
Two can live as cheap as one
But I'm learning twice your earning
Doesn't mean it's twice the fun
If you spend each dime and all your time
On someone else's schemes
I'm not needy but I'm greedy
And I live my deepest dreams
Take an hour in the shower
Use the water while it's hot in the tub
A hand to scrub my back
Is all I haven't got
Self-aware with self-esteem
Is selfishness a crime
I take the day for quite a ride
And I take my own sweet time
Time to spare and time to share
And grateful I would be
If just one damn man
Would share the need
To be alone with me

[Eva:]
To think that a man as famous as you are
Could love a poor little nothing like me

[Eva:]
I wanna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Eva's family:]
She wants to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

[Che:]
Just listen to that
They're on to you Magaldi
I'd get out while you can

[Eva:]
It's happened at last
I'm starting to get started
I'm moving out with my man

[Magaldi:]
Now Eva don't get carried away

[Eva:]
Monotony past
Suburbia departed
Who could ever be fond
Of the back of beyond?

[Magaldi:]
Don't hear words that I didn't say

[Eva's family:]
What's that? You'd desert the girl you love?

[Magaldi:]
The girl I love?
What are you talking about?

[Eva's family:]
She really brightened up your out-of-town engagement
She gave you all she had, she wasn't in your contract
You must be quite relieved that no-one's told the papers so far

[Eva:]
I wanna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

Would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would stay together

[Eva's brother:]
Seems to me there's no point in resisting
She's made up her mind, you've no choice
Why don't you be the man who discovered her
You'll never be remembered for your voice

[Magaldi:]
The city can be paradise for those who have the cash
The class and the connections, what you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up in the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class ...

[Eva:]
Screw the middle classes! I will never accept them!
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight, hidden from view at his funeral.

[Eva's brother:]
Do all your one-night stands give you this trouble?

[Magaldi:]
Eva, beware of the city
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled
It is mad
Those who are fools are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become what they should not become
Changed, in short, they go bad.

[Eva:]
Bad is good for me
I'm bored, so clean, and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here, so why oh why oh why the hell can't I?
I only want variety of society

[Eva:]
I wanna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Eva's family:]
She wants to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

[Magaldi:]
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say, You have your way, come to town.
But you'll look at me with a foreigner's eyes
The magical city, a younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down

[Eva:]
All you've done to me, was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city games alright, didn't I?
I already know what cooks, how the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn't I?

[Eva:]
I'm gonna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
[Eva and family:]
She's gonna be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple

[Magaldi:]
Eva, beware your ambition
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled
Will run wild
This in a man is danger enough, but you are a woman 
Not even a woman, not very much more than a child
And whatever you say
I'll not steal you away

With sweet I Love Yous and some pretty lines
But that won't get you in this heart of mine
No, you'll never steal my heart away

I'm telling you

If you want me to believe
That I'm the only one you need

And your kiss could never tell a lie

Now that's what I call a man!What are you gonna do about Warren?
That's the first time in my life I felt like the opposite sex.
What are you gonna do about Warren? I wonder if he'll ask me
tomorrow night. What are you gonna do about Warren? What am I
gonna do about Warren? Oh, Warren doesn't care.Warren cares!
Warren cares, but I don't care! You have to care because you're
engaged to him and you don't have to care about him because how
will he know he cares about you? Then what are you gonna do?
What did you say?

When you know there's someone loving you
And you know there's someone you love too
And they're not the same, what do you do?
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
Close your eyes and hide from every care
When you wake up they may not be there
But tell me how can I sleep
Tell me who could
When you see your whole life tangled up good
I could drink, I could weep
But tell me how can I sleep?
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
And when you and someone have a date
(Which you made when you were thinking straight!)
And when you and someone stay out late
(It was bad too...)
Mmm...But I had to!
When they're not the same who gets the gate?
(This is not the way to find a mate!)
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
( Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!)
Comes the dawn I may not feel the same
(Comes the dawn he may not know your name!)
In the sunlight who can see a flame?
But tell me how can I sleep, look what I've done
Mess around with two men
Soon you'll have none
As you sow, so you reap
Which is why I can't sleep, mmm...
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go to...

Oh, my love it makes me sad.
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?

Baby, give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow.
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye

Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Yet it seems to make me sad.
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?

Baby, give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?
So dance while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow.
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own

I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Dido:]
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.
We should be together, too

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air Tonight
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,‚Äîshut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
[*car tires squeal, crash, loud splash*]

[Eminem:]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you
Damn!

I took a trip into the ocean
High emotion filled me with desire
I had to see what I was fighting
That kept inviting me to take it higher

Well looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it, try to make it whole

I took a walk into the fire
When I heard you calling me
I took a chance and what a good thing
It turned out to be

It turned out
It turned out
It turned out
It turned out to be

Well now it's done and out of nowhere
I can go wherever pleases me
If you don't mind some stormy weather
We'll be together in our fantasy

Looking back it didn't hurt me
It did something for my soul
It taught me when you find a love
Don't break it

By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you,
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you

When I'm not there so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to stay and
When I'm gone

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere so
Bring on the party
I'm gonna have fun
Maybe meet someone
And when I get home
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess that you thought
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore

Don't worry I'm not angry

Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes

It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
Won't see another one
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway
Was waiting for me

You were handsome! You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
And we kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

And the boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum, you're a punk
You're an old cut on junk
Lying there almost dead
On a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy blagger
Merry Christmas, you mugger
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing out
For Christmas day

I could have been someone
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me
When I first found you
I took them with me, babe
I kept them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you

Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing out

3880,Ed Sheeran,2019,Remember The Name,No.6 Collaborations Project,"

[Ed Sheeran:]
Yeah I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
Stick to singing, stop rapping like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just being on the rich list
Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is going numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in this song might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy, and you know nothing about my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you Remember The Name
And if you thought I was good well then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent In Da Club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

[Eminem:]
Hey, hey, hey
I can still remember (What?)
Tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL, I climbed the Billboard charts
To the top until as fate would have it (Yeah)
Became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time'll tell (What?) If I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) Put Nine Inch Nails (Where?)
In my eye-lids now (What?) I'm seeing diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (Yeah) Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no if ands or butts, are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me, 'cause you're only fuckin' living in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my death bed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So, why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

[Ed Sheeran and Eminem:]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

[50 Cent:]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You could find me in my whip rockin my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shining, wrist with the rocks on it
Buscemi's the locks on it
Everything my voice on, the shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit, and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch we be ballin' out, the king bringing 50 bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout the shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over, 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Ed Sheeran and 50 Cent:]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Aye-aye, aye-aye

_x000D_
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

I'm so ashamed
You're in so much pain
I blamed you when things didn't go my way
If I didn't, you'd be here
If I didn't fight back, I'd have no fear
If I took another path, things would be so different, but they're not
I could've just kept my big mouth closed
I could've just done what I was told
Maybe I should've turned silver into gold
But in front of you I was cold

I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not afraid to say
I wish I could take it back, but I can't

I thought we had it all
You brought out the best in me
And somehow I destroyed the perfect dream
I thought we were indestructible
I never imagined we could fall
You wanna know how to make God laugh?
Tell him your plans

We could've bought a house with a swimming pool
Filled it up with Warhols, it would be so cool
Could've gone riding stallions in the countryside
With a pack of Great Danes, racing eye to eye
We could've toured the world in a private jet
Gone naked on the beach, all soaking wet
We could've climbed the mountains
Seen a perfect sunrise
Written our names across the sky
We could've gotten drunk and driven on the Autobahn
We could've got ourselves arrested in St. Germain
We could've lived life crazy 'til the day we died
Instead I made you cry

I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, je suis d√©sol√©e
I wish I could take it back
But I can't
I fucked up, I made a mistake
Nobody does it better than myself
I'm sorry, I'm not ashamed to say
I wish I could have you back, maybe one day
Or not

Gathered before you are 5 of the finest wordsmiths known to mankind

Tinie Tempah, come in

A hundred thousand people everybody mosh pittin
I make the most of every minute that the clock give me
So come and rock with me everybody rockin out
I make em jump till there's a hole in the fucking ground
Pose for a picture, nigga I am so off the Richter
All I do is shots shots shots, I don't use no cup or no mixer
I rock all my clothes like a hipster and I rock them shades like a G
That girl be definitely coming if she's coming with me
I'm like a hundred degrees man I'm even hotter than August

Where my Paracetamol and Anadin and a crystal ball for my n-n-n-nig Labrinth

Kano, come in

Said I been gone for a hot minute
Who put my Rolex on the radiator
Back like boomerang I'm Don D'ing it
But you might see me later alligator
In some Bally lace ups, with some jacket tapered
So much stones you thought it was animation
Wilma on my case cause all these chicks adjacent
To my table tryna drink my vodka and champagne up
I ain't no Matt Damon, but Bourne with Ultimatums
Get rich or die trying so we started cakin
I'm doing Kane but not the brother of Undertaker
And I ain't Muslim but tell my brothers Assalamu Alaykum
Finish Him! Kano my niggas no Raiden
Fuck with my darg then my nigga Alsatian
Tell a man WHHHOO make a man blazing

Diamonds all in your face dry shaving
And the gyal dem call me Earthquake
Cause I make their pussy cave in
I'm a beast

Wretch 32, come in

Got so much cuts I had to teach myself 1st Aid
I'm tryin to learn to play safe
I never get caught out before I get to third base
But still they see me coming I lash in your face

Pure waste and the flows pants I'm a trouser dem
Throw a little cheese at the rats
Say we're labbin em, you see I'm a be a bigger cat
Watch me scratch it in, scratch it in, scratch it in
I ain't here for no packaging, ain't the cutest brother brother
But shaped like a mannequin
Ladies throwing me their clothes, then using their apocalypse
Brother you ain't got no inner soul put a sock in it

They thought I disappeared, I just did a gap year like a fresher came back like a graduate
Now everybody's scared 'cause the damage that I've done with two songs is probably more than their album did
Be afraid, be afraid I'm a get'cha
Little Lab's making earthquakes in America
I ain't the Messiah but they call me the creator
When I said let there be light how many stars did I make huh?
Yeah I got the Midas touch, got gold diggers looking at my fine wrist watch
Even got the restaurant to fine dine this fox
Better call me by my name that's right it's Boss now
Levels levels I take the levels up triples
Just take those triples and triple it I'm so far gone
I'm high can't get me down like a hard on
Cause the morning says glory when a star is born.
Hello

There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth, what's it worth
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinkin' in
If we're going down together better take another hit
We won't be here forever so let's make the best of it

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Walking down to the burial ground with a sad song in his brain
General Cloud is an old man now but it feels like yesterday
He was on the front lines, stranded on the beach
Crawling to his best friend, floatin' in the sea
But he didn't make it, he still can't believe
How arbitrary fate is, he says...

There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt

If we're going down together better take another hit
We won't be here forever so let's make the best of it

She went down to her job in town with a sad song in her heart
33 with a wasted dream to become a movie star
Living outta suitcase, serving at a bar
Saving up some pennies working after dark
Is she gonna make it, she still can't believe
How arbitrary fate is, she says...

There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth, what's it worth
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinkin' in
If we're going down together better take another hit
We won't be here forever so let's make the best of it

Now all these people wanna keep on taking pieces of me
They take away everything, had everything that I needed
They held me down, let me drown
They spit me out right through the teeth
I can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again
It was a breeze for you
These hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain

As I scrape away through the impossible
Yeah, I played the game but it was all for show
Tryna find my way, I nearly lost it though
Now I see dead people, most have no faith
Where did the time go? A watch with no face
They hit the ceiling but my roof likes space
I took my chances so won't you

H8 is the one for me
It gives me all I need
Helps me co-exist
With the chill

You make me sick
Because I adore you so
I love all the dirty tricks
And twisted games you play on me

Space dementia in your eyes
And peace will arise
And tear us apart
And make us meaningless again

You'll make us wanna die
I'd cut your name in my heart
We'll destroy this world for you
I know you want me to
Feel your pain

And peace will arise
And tear us apart
And make us meaningless again

If I didn't love you
I'd be safe from harm.
I would never find myself
Lost inside your arms.
If I didn't love you
I'd never feel the pain
Of sunny days without you
Drowning in the rain.
If I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you
Peace would rule the day
All the dark and out would surely go away.
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't pay the cost
Of living every endless day
If our love is lost.
If I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you...

And yet you make me breathless
At the way you move
I never knew that I
Could ever love the way we do.
I don't know how you reach me
In that place in my heart
Belonging to only you.

If I didn't love you
I wouldn't lose control
The danger loving brings a word
Never touch my soul.
If I didn't love you
Perhaps I wouldn't die.
If you should ever say to me
I'm sorry, goodbye.
If I didn't love you...
How can there be music
In the way you touch?
I can't believe that somehow
I believe in you so much.
Now you've come and taught me
How to give you my heart.
And make me feel at last
That the end will never start.
You're the only reason
I'm not afraid to fall.
For if I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you...
I wouldn't love at all.

Oh yeah, oh-ooh-ooh
Yeah-hey, oh-no

It's another night, another day
It's another street with another name
Just another storm, just another rain
But now nothing feels the same
Yesterday I thought this was solid ground
Just another thing I was wrong about
But I never learn till I crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don't try this at home

Guess what now, I can live without
All the foolish love people talk about
Better by myself with no one around
(Yeah-yeah)
But that's what I'm saying now
But that's such a lie 'cause I know that once
I look in her eyes, I fall back in love
But I never learn till I crash and burn
Just another textbook case of

Playing with fire (with fire)
When I should have left love alone

Call me crazy but I've been here before
And I promised myself that I wouldn't fall
But look at me now I'm so lost (ooh-ooh)
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way because
I have a problem with one thing I shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous
But I can't keep on

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Crystal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
This kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B

Let me live that fantasy
Snoop...
Let me live this fantasy
I wanna live this fantasy
Snoop...

Want you to make me feel
Like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Cause
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying Lord I just don't care
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

I got the eye of the tiger
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am the champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

It don't run in our blood
This kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule

Let me live this fantasy
I wanna live this fantasy
I wanna live this fantasy

Let me live, let me live, let me live, let me live

We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doing the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy

It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Sliding the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the living things
Under the sun
Under the sun

Little brother
I think you're an angel
See your silver chain levitate
When you're kick-flipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared
So was I
But all will be revealed in time

Oh look, the rays are in the bay now
Can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around?
I can make anything real
Brain so hot, it's a summer body
Every day is blue and never cloudy
Don't look down
I can make anything real

In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist or my widow's peak?
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak?
Will she split a tab with her lover and laugh at the stars
Like her mother when she was a girl?
When she was a girl

Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
Just had to breathe out and tune in
Just had to breathe out and tune in
I just had to breathe out and tune in
I just had to breathe out and tune in
Just had to breathe

O, was enlightenment found? No, but I'm trying
Taking it one year at a time
O, can you hear the sound? It's shimmering higher

To take off my robes and step into the choir

And after all this time
My heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Then take a look inside me
And watch my heartstrings come undone
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm
Is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

Can you see me, here I am (here I am)
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart and still find (you're my)
You're my safest place to hide

You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel my soul unfolding
Like a flower blooming
When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to go
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home

Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart and still find
You're my safest place to hide

I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm
Is raging outside

Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me even better than that
Sweet lady

Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the back-roads heading south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars
After losing every battle

I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes
Don't look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
Building burned
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
Springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn

Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I was somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory

I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We're idiots, babe
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves

We'll have you down soon

No one to tell me what to do
No one to hold my hand
Bellamy's got a lot to do
And I hope that you'll understand

Nobody here to spoil the view
Interfere with my plans
Bellamy's got a job to do
And he's hoping you'll understand

Steady, Lads
And Easy Does It
Ooooh, don't frighten him!
Here we go...

I'm not coming down
No matter what say
I like it up here anyway

Sit tight, Mr. Bellamy
This shouldn't take long

In the delusionary state
No wonder he's been feeling strange of late

A while ago I heard the sound of children's laughter
Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down, it's getting dark

I realize I'm cold
The rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on, it's time to go
It's time at last to let him know

I believe it would be fair to say
You look bewildered
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should, I would
When I left I felt I'd had enough
But in the shape and form I appear now
I have learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down

I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind
I'm not the same this time around
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

Will you leave me standing in the hall
Or let me enter?
The apartment hasn't changed at all
I got to say I'm glad
Once these rooms were witness to our love
My tantrums and increasing frustration
But I go from mad
To not so bad in my transformation

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded
I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down

I'm not the one you knew
I'm now and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind now
I'm not the same this time around
I'm fired up, don't shut me down

You asked me not to leave
Well, here I am again
And I love you still and so I won't pretend
I have learned to cope
And love and hope is why I am here now

I'm just a roustabout
Shifted from town to town
No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy
There's a lot of space beneath that sky
Till I find my place there's no doubt...
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

Call me the carefree kind
I wander with the breeze
My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye
I'll give her a quick hello, and a fast goodbye

I'll go the way I want
Driftin' just like the sand
Doin' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

I'll be a rovin' roustabout...I'll be a rovin' roustabout

I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah. . .

And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah. . .

White man, white man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?

Oh the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah. . .

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race

White man, white man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone

Then forget how to learn

Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember, the pain of December

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty
Like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not what you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

I let it go and now I know
A brand new life is down this road
And when it's right, you always know
So this time I won't let go

There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late

I've broken free from those memories
I've let it go, I've let it go
And two goodbyes led to this new life
Don't let me go, don't let me go

Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

Won't let you go, don't let me go
Won't let you go, don't let me go

Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say, I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can

See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

I never feel a thing is real
When I'm away from you
Out of your embrace
The world's a temporary parking place

Mmm, mm, mm, mm
A bubble for a minute
Mmm, mm, mm, mm
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it

Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Daydreaming while the rest of the world's awake
I always knew I didn't belong here
People told me I was different
I guess I was afraid of the concept
But once you learn to embrace who you are
Things can get real ugly
Go!

[Verse 1: Labrinth]
What's my name?
What's my name, I don't need no intro
Pass the dutch,
Dim the lights and tell Sally I'm gone
Fuck a mic I need a stone right now
See your life's about to drop
I'm gonna party like I did take the paint in the town
And someone just pissed in my..

It's gonna be a fucking atomic explosion [x2]

Odd job, got bangers all day
You fuckers don't seem to listen, smash hits on the radio
Do I need to say any more? Just pay me, uh
Plenty bitches replicating what I made before
So Hail Mary, while you get buried
You think you could come near me, you handed the card clearly
You fuck with the same game while I'm I'm popping a new cherry
Plan B tell tell these rudebois coz they don't hear me

[Plan B]
Say hey Lord,
Look at me still going hard
All I needed was a little vacation
But I'm back now to do my job
Fuck the glitz and glamour, that shit just doesn't matter
I refuse to talk about it while I'm spitting on this banger
And I refuse to talk 'bout money, no one's rich up in my manor
They don't find that shit too funny, specially if they in the slammer
I spit for the youth the whole youth, and nothing but the youth
I might be getting old but I still care about the truth
So while we're on the topic, I'mma treat it like a fucking bomb
And drop it

[Bridge]
I'm a loose cannon, enter the dragon
Got the mic in my hand, it's about to do damage, clear
Fire in the hole, Fire Fire in the hole,
Fire Fire in the hole
Listen I'm a loose cannon, might see your bitch vanish
Got the mic in my hand, it's about to do damage, clear
Fire in the hole, Fire Fire in the hole

Get me down on my knees

It's a lot like life
This play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

It's a lot like life
And that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one

Domination's the name of the game
In bed or in life
They're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled
At the end of the day

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

Let's play master and servant

We met.

You melted me with your tender touch.
I felt all fear and sorrow slip away.
Now here we stand
Hand in hand
This blessed day.

I promise you
As I give to you my heart
That nothing in this world
Shall keep us apart.
Come happily ever after be
The man I'll love until the very end.

For God must know
How I love you so.

2818,Bob Dylan,1981,Lenny Bruce,Shot Of Love,"
_x000D_
Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, that's for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit's living on and on.

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies' heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.

Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before it's time
I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half
Seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and the ones that killed him are gone.

They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

[Barbra:]
It's raining, it's pouring
My love-life is boring me to tears, after all these years
[Donna:]
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

[Barbra:]
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love

[Both:]
Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

[Donna:]
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

[Barbra:]
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

[Donna:]
Tell him to just get out

[Barbra:]
Nothing left to talk about

[Donna:]
Pack his raincoat show him out

[Both:]
Just look him in the eye and simply shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

[Donna:]
If you've reached the end, don't pretend that is right when it's over

[Barbra:]
(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

[Donna:]
(over, over)

[Both:]
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

[Barbra:]
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (Tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

[Both:]
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
No more tears (No more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it he's had it, we've had is

[Donna:]
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover

[Barbra:]
But he turned out to be like every other man

[Both:]
I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough

I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her
Send her back to me

She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone

I've gotta find my baby
I gotta hold her tight and tell her I love her
Tell her everything's all right
So I'll keep searching
All night long
'Cause I ain't had no lovin' 
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone 

I've gotta find my baby
I've gotta find my baby
Gotta find my baby

What do you know about it?
Well, you gonna tell me...
Why, I can't tell you. You don't - you can't - you can't explain now what's going on in your brain. You can't tell somebody how - wha-what's happening, what's going on in your- I can't.
Why don't you just try?

Let those fools be loud, let alarms ring out
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the days be dark, let me hate my work
'Cause you cut through all the noise

Bring me some hope
By wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto
Morning, noon, day, or night

You were the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tie to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time

Let the parties end when we lose our friends
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the years roll on 'till the static comes
'Cause you cut through all the noise

Bring me some hope
By wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto
Morning, noon, day, or night

You were the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tie to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time
All the time, all the time
I think of you all the time

Bring me some hope
By wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto
Morning, noon, day, or night

You were the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tie to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea

All the time, all the time

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
Fame

I know you never even try, girl
C'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon), c'mon (C'mon)
Please please me, oh yeah, like I please you

You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say love

Please please me, oh yeah, like I please you

I don't wanna sound complaining

I do all the pleasing with you, it's so hard to reason
With you, oh yeah, why do you make me blue

You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, Oh my God, he's trippin'
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
But 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald
Shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her
While I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled, so's my manager
Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives'll butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into captcha
When I pull 'em like sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a ten, you're an eight, like what I do before, after, and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge my degrees
It's the same as I got in college (zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me
While you hose me off And nope I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
I got a lotta more
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (sodomy)
'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head. I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they were scared of
But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
Another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
(I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
(I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
(I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know

I've been
Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home

So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I've ever seen
Hey sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' Are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

Sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

(I'll tell you what happened. . .)

They took me to a room without a table
They said blow your trumpet into here
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

And I was
Sleepin' like a princess
Never touched the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(have to have some fun. . .)

Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
And that I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here

I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and I
Sure do wanna go home

And how I love to watch it change expressions.
Each look becomes the pride of my possessions.

I love that face, that face, it just isn't fair.
You must forgive the way that I stare,
But never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace

That face, That face, That face.

I love those eyes, those lips, that fabulous smile.
She laughs and Spring goes right out of style.

Oh never will these eyes behold a sight that could replace
That face, That face, That face, That face,

But it's just the bottle that's run dry
Lose the watch cause we got nothing on
And I'm not keeping track of time!

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all

Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move

So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body

Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret

When I wake up probably I'm gonna text ya
Heard you got a man

How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could put me here, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, in the sky
Looking up, you're a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night everything's alright
When you lay down I'mma hit the lights
If you say so
What's a life if you don't got me
Give you what you want, what you need
What you came for
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room

Isn't it rich, are we a pair
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss, don't you approve
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns
Send in the clowns
Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there
Don't you love a farce,
My fault I fear,
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry my dear!
But where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Quick send in the clowns
What a surprise,
Who could foresee?
I'd come to feel about you
What you felt about me?
Why only now when I see
That you've drifted away?
What a surprise...
What a cliche...
Isn't it rich, isn't it queer
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns
Quick send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

[Eminem:]
Here we go again from heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo but we both were jilted
A couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope that we'll get
Through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-elope would be dope
But what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size, hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you'd die for
Sticks a steak knife in your heart, do you try more?
Another late night in, she stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in and all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent, but she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in; I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and who's probably screwed five more
Guys, sucked eight/nine men
I'm takin' two-by-fours to our eight-by-tens
Bitch it's you I tore out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin' for the day I can
Hear you say, Marshall, what a skank I've been!
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays, like when you get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true, just to scream Fuck you!
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since

[Jessie Reyez:]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater, convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy
They like, You're the good guy, they like, they like
They like, You're the good guy

Yeah

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, we

We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker

Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker

Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody

Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, Shady ease up!
Man, chill! Nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During an earthquake, urine in your face
'Cause you're fake Ow! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
Ow! What the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'
Alright then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you

Ask me why, man, I just don't know

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, 'til then, I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh, bitches don't like that, homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, I was writing this and I thought of you, so

Take away, the scent of flowers
Cover up, the sky of blue
Close my ears to tender love songs
They remind me too much of you

Hide young lovers warm embraces
Keep stars and moonlight from my view
Let me forget, there are such places
They remind me too much of you

Must I evermore be haunted?
Day after day, my whole life through
By the memory of each moment
That I spent alone with you

If these lovely things dont hurt you
Our love just wasnt meant to be
But please come back to me, my darling
If they remind you, too much of me

They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Fearless when it comes to playing games

Afraid to have a love affair

Time slows down. I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded dark hallways

I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

What's the problem I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again

I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver

Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

(Oh no) And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that

Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go? 
I just don't know
But still my love for you will live forever

Hasta Manana 'til we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Manana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Manana, baby, Hasta Manana, until then

Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
Where did they go? 
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you

Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die

There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass ‚Äî where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been Bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot ‚Äî fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man ‚Äî clack [*click*]

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years ‚Äî no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?

No more do I see the starlight caress your hair
No more feel the tender kisses we used to share
I close my eyes and clearly my heart remembers
A thousand good-byes could never put out the embers

Darling I love you so and my heart forever
Will belong to the memory of the love that we knew before
Please come back to my arms, we belong together
Come to me let's be sweethearts again and then let us part no more.

No more do I feel the touch of your hand on mine
No more see the lovelight making your dark eyes shine
Oh how I wish I never had caused you sorrow
But don't ever say for us there is no tomorrow

Darling I love you so and my heart forever
Will belong to the memory of the love that we knew before
Please come back to my arms, we belong together

Seems like forever and a day

If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind, I've done all I should
I won't ask of you what I would not do

Oh, I saw the damage in you
My fortunate one, the envy of youth

Why would they tell me to please those that laugh in my face?
When all of the reasons they've taught us fall over themselves to give way, oh yeah

It's not a question of whether my heart is true
Streamlined, I had to pull through
Look for a new beginning on you

Oh, I, I got a message for you, ooh
Up and away, it's what I got to do, ooh
Forgive what you have for what you might lose

What would you say if I told you that I'm to blame?
And what would you do if I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away? Oh, yeah
And who should I turn to if not for the ones that you could not save? Oh, now

I told you when I found you
If there were doubts, you should be careful and unafraid
Now they surround you
And all that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain

So, if my affections are misunderstood
And you decide I'm up to no good
Don't ask me to enjoy them just for you

Ask yourself why I would choose to prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame? Oh yeah
When you should have turned to the hearts
Of the ones that you would not save

I told you when I found you
All that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain

They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Tumble blindly as they make their way

Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake, I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright,
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard, 'cause I know
When the sun comes up I will leave
This is my last glance that will soon be a memory

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over
Start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want
All that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close

Wet is rain
Rain is clean and new
New is the morning
And morning dew
Wet is a kiss that touches you
Wet is sea
Sea is mysterious blue
Blue is for sadness
And sad is for crying
Tears are wet too
Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain
Drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade
Sometimes
I'm not afraid of melt in the rain
I'm not afraid to be lost at see
I'm not afraid to cry again
Because it's tears of joy
You bring to me
Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain
Drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade
Sometimes
Wet is love
Love that's flowing free
Free is the feeling I feel deep inside me
Come and see that wet is me...

Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go
To cry their tears, blue river
It winds along a path of heartache and pain
Of broken dreams from lovin' someone in vain
Like I loved you, and baby I still do
I held you so tight
You were out of my sight
I'm feelin' so low
But I gotta go
Blue river because you never really cared about me
From now on baby that's where I'm gonna be
Cryin' over you, by the river of blue

That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight

Listen, I'd be a liar if I told you that I didn't see it coming
Be more of a liar if I said, Hey, I didn't want it to be something.
You deserve much better for the love that you have shared
I know you won't believe it, but girl, I swear

That I got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

I know you feel it 'cause you stayed
There is much more to this story
But I'd be a fool to say I trust her and I'm always gonna love her
You know that you don't wanna hear
How I'm living on the edge, baby
So I just say, Yeah, baby
She ain't nothing, but she is real
But why I take her through it

When I still got love for you, big love for you
Even when I'm tripping
The fact remains that you will always be my baby
My baby
But dig the truth, baby, dig the truth
I can't hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places
I got you in my life and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two
And he don't wanna lie, but he can't tell the truth?
What's a man to do when he's loving two
But he can't keep his heart in two different places?
(Not in two different places)

I wanna tell you it's over, that I ain't thinking of her
I wanna really mean it, that I want you to see it
That I'm really trying to leave her behind
And I'm trying not to make you cry
I wanna tell you that I ain't playing games
And I'm dedicated to receive a change
But when I look in the mirror, it's the same old man

That my heart is in two different places (oh)
I got you in my life (my life) and I wanna do right
But it's hard to let it go
When my love has two different faces (faces)
And I can't break ties 'cause they both look right
Someone tell me, what's a man to do when he's loving two

There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true?

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away all the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear?

We're lost in a cloud with too much rain
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly

Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
And while I can think,
While I can talk
While I can stand,
While I can walk
While I can dream,
Please let my dream come true... right now
Let it come true right now

5830,Maroon 5,2010,No Curtain Call(iTunes & Deluxe Edition Bonus Track),Hands All Over,"

[Verse 1:]
You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only tryin' to help

[Bridge:]
As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever forever forever

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[Verse 2:]
I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

[Bridge:]
As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through 
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together 
Fight these demons off forever
Forever forever forever

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call, I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[2nd Bridge:]
Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossin' and turnin', you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call, I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all


[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call, I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

For every child to see
This time the morning sun
Is burning just for me
I've got the skyward eyes
Like I've never had before
Just smile and  say  goodbye
Show me to the door
For every one there comes a precious time
To break away
I  mean  to  shine
Oh,  I  mean  to  shine
As I look  at all the morning  sun
I know I mean to shine
This day  I  realized
The  world  I  knew  is  gone
New seasons  come  and  change
The crown that stood upon
I've  been  afraid to feel
And scared of falling free
You  said  so I'm  real
It seemed  so clear to me
For everyone who breathes
There comes a time to fly  away
I  mean  to  shine
0h, I  mean  to shine
As  I  look at all the morning  sun
I know I mean to shine
For everyone who breathes
There comes a time
To break away

Have pity on this heart of mine

Wait before you take your lips from mine.
How quickly where we are is where we've been.
And give is given.

Once before I knew that I'd be yours
A moment didn't seem a thing at all.
Just like a penny at a fair.

Once I never dreamed there'd come a time
When time would need another day
Another week, another year with you.
Forever doesn't mean forever anymore.

Wait before we take another breath,
Before you take your lips away from mine,
And where we are is where we've been.

Oh wait...
When you're in love the way we are,
When every kiss and every touch,
And every nite is like a dream come true
It's then you realize how small forever is.
As I now I do.

With you.

Hit Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (Ugh)
Like a stirrup (Stirrup)
Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up (Yeah)
Now I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (Haha)

I be on my own (Yeah, woo), head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, You ain't the GOAT, I come down like, Who?
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus
Swear, I can see the game from a bird's-eye view, ayy
Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy
Girl, you talkin' to a monsta, ayy
You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
They gon' turn around‚Äî

Popped it back in and hopped up like, Fuck it (Fuck it)
Best two out of three, yeah
Man, I gotta be doin' (What?) somethin' right
I got eleven years of sobriety (Yeah)
So the only bottom I'ma be hittin' is if it's sodomy
Wait, I mean, you would think that somebody handed a saw to me
How I'm choppin' these bars
They keep wantin' me to rap responsibly
When I'm constantly passin' the buck like the fuckin' Dollar Tree
But I'ma always remind you that I came from poverty
Black people saved my life, from the Doc and Deshaun
And all that we want is racial equality
R.I.P. Laquan McDonald, Trayvon, and Breonna
Atatiana, Rayshard, and Dominique
Eric Garner and Rodney King
No, we can't get along 'til these white motherfuckin' cops
Who keep murderin' Blacks are off the streets (Off the streets)
And, as far as squashin' beef, I'm used to people knockin' me
But, just not in my camp
I'm diplomatic 'cause I'm tryna be
Last thing I need is Snoop doggin' me
Man, dog, you was like a (Yeah) damn god to me
Nah, not really (Haha)
I had dog backwards
But I'm startin' to think, all these people takin' shots at me
Shit, it's no wonder

I be on my own, head up in the clouds like Zeus
When they say, You ain't the GOAT, I come down like, Who?
But I got my head in the clouds like Zeus

_x000D_
As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occurred yet
And things that they don't wanna take responsibility for

I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know

That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect

I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there

Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

I understand that there are some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just trying to stay busy 'til you heard from dad

When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree

He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief

I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

I understand that there are some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show

If I can't apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me

You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
Said you can put the blame on me
You can put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
They were dead wrong trying to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani

I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl trying to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young

I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a 21-and-older club they say

Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryna entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me
You can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me

And you can put that blame on me
And you can put that blame on me

You always told me forget the haters

It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'

Tired of lettin' passive-aggression

Don't get so busy that you miss
Giving just a little kiss
To the ones you love
Don't even wait a little while
To give them just a little smile
A little is enough

How many people are crying
People are dying...
How many people are asking for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love...

How could you wait another minute
A hug is warmer when you're in it
And Baby that's a fact
And saying I love you's always better
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter
So don't hold back
How many people in this world
So needful in this world
How many people are praying for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love...

Let all the children know
Everywhere that they go
Their whole life long
Let them know love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on

I don't feel like that 'cause it's me y'know
I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years
But, every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far
'Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten until you look around and, and you look at the people who who, who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that, that no matter what, it's in the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know
It's not gonna be about my connections
It's not gonna be about my looks
It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most
And, I want it the most!

That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you

And it's hard
The days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars
Are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you

Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

Is the hardest part
The beauty within you
Oh oh oh oh
Its the hardest thing to find
Oh oh oh oh
As the mirror makes you blind
Oh oh oh oh
As the mirror makes you blind
A beautiful a shining star
Ohh the beauty within you

Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husband and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

Many choices to make
Many chains to unravel
Every path that we take
Makes it harder to travel
Laughter turned to sorrow
Doesn't get me down
Chasing tomorrow

When tomorrow comes around
You'll be looking at the future
So, keep your feet upon the ground
And get ready to run

Now hear me, mothers and men
Hear me, sisters and brothers
Teach your children and then
They can pass it to others
Some of them may borrow
Tales you handed down
Chasing tomorrow

Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husband and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow
Get ready to run

Chasing tomorrow
Get ready to run

People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
With one person one very special person
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried

I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different

Time against us (time against us)
Miles between us (miles between us)

Sirens bleed through my windowsill

Don‚Äôt control what I‚Äôm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
The sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I‚Äôm into

This is now my home, my home

I‚Äôm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I‚Äôm blazing on the street
What I do isn‚Äôt up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I‚Äôm used to
The shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I‚Äôm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I‚Äôm blazing on the street
What I do isn‚Äôt up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I‚Äôm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I‚Äôm blazing on the street
What I do isn‚Äôt up to you
And if the city never sleeps

Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

I fit you better than your favorite sweater, 
You know, that love is mean, love hurts
You still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember, 
Baby oh
I will love you 'til the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said I had to leave to start my life over
You were like: No please, stay here
We don't need no money we can make it all work
But I headed out on Sunday, said I'd come home Monday
You stayed up waitin', anticipatin', and pacin' 
But I was, chasing paper
Caught up in the game that was the last you heard, Oh baby

Faces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know
When I'll go

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah
And I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a global trance
Or fans, some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
'Cuz no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin jam
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin in
I'm goin home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the UK
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, take one look
Better yet, take two
But if I take that break, there's a move you made
This dude you shape will come take you back
Back to the roots I've been
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
A star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael
M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood line's not a family tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly

(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

Here we are
At the end of the road - a road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't - we don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun, and watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, (how we got this far...)

They left us alone
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
What a shame
What a shame
Beautiful scars
On critical veins
Come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

(The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

Here we are at the top of the hill - a hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill- the kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star, and watch its fire burn into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

They left us alone
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
What a shame
What a shame
Beautiful scars
On critical veins
Come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

Whoa
Whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa
Whoa

They left us alone
The kids in the dark
To burn out forever
Or light up a spark
We come together
State of the art
We'll never surrender
The kids in the dark
So let the world sing
What a shame
What a shame
Beautiful scars
On critical veins

2287,Barbra Streisand,1975,So Long Honey Lamb,soundtrack: Funny Lady,"

[Fanny & chorus:]
So long honey lamb I'll be seeing you time for us to part
I'll be twinkling
So long honey lamb I'll be keeping you right here in my heart
Watch me winckeling
Think of this as temporary
Just a toedeloe
Toeldeloe to you too
How much will I miss you
How much
Very
Let that see you through
But in the mean time
So long honey lamb we'll be close again
Baby don't cry
Someday we'll be nose to nose again
someday bye and bye
In a world that has no winter were each month is June
So long honey lamb I'll be seeing you soon

I certainly know I'm gonna miss the old plantation
And the sound of banjo's thrumming on the summernights
I certainly know I hate my common situation
Because I'm on a cord and wings and I'm afraid from heights
I'm certainly gonna miss the taste of watermelon
And the fields I ran and the hills I hiked
All I'm gonna get to meet up here is angels
And to tell the truth I never met an angel my life
I certainly know I didn't trew a lucky seven
Though I'm hardly a complainer and a wooden carp
I wonder what the hell I'm gonna do in heaven
I could never plug a chicken and alone a harp
When you gotta go they tell you
Well you gotta go
When you gotta go they tell you
You gotta go
So faith my child has pluses and minuses
Golden dust is cleansing my sinuses
Rise above if that's what you gotta do
Look up I am ca ca I got news for you
So long honey lamb I'll be seeing you soon
Look for me in the moon
I'll be seeing you soon

I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da

I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you
Da da, da da, da da

I'll shit on you
I will shit on you
I'll shit on you
Girl you know it's true
I'll shit on you
Bitch or man
I'll shit on you
I will shit on you

I remain fatter than gluttony
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow them up if they ain't want me
The National Guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes ducking me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothing up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screaming
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll shit on you!)
I'll shit on you!

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit on you!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll shit on you!)

I'm a alcoholic with the fucking toilet
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch shut your fucking mouth
I'm a keep eating 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out
My fuckin' wife
I haven't had sex since I met her
I'm to busy fucking, your 12 year old baby sitter
And all women ain't shit
Only good for cooking, cleaning
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
I was responsible for killing John Candy
I got Jonbenet Ramsey in my Ninety Eight Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody
Truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident, is I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who raised me and say the can take me
Come on
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants down and
(I'll shit on you!)

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit on you!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll shit on you!)

Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel God dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
Will hang you up naked by your ankles dangling
Come on
My need I stay strangling
I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you with it across your chest

Yo, it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(Hey, hey, hey!)
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fighting Peablo Bryson (I'll shit on you)
So what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out
Niggas get hit with a two piece, Bling Bling
With a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit on you!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
(I'll shit on you!)

Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'Til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll shit on you!)
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too 
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy girl dog woman man child
(I'll shit on you!)

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
(I'll shit on you!)
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
(I'll shit on you!)
I will fuck your wife if you fuck with me
(I'll shit on you!)

You heard me, bitch
(I'll shit on you!)
D12
(I'll shit on you!)
You life, your wife, your kids, your car
(I'll shit on you!)
Your house, your spouse, your rings, your things
(I'll shit on you!)
(I'll shit on you!)

But I don't wanna brag, I Louis-Vuitton-bagged him
Hopped out the jag, proceeded to shag-shagg him

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can‚Ä¶

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)

I went to the far right
Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity

I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost

I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover, my own identity

I guess I'm lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

No, I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity, and craziness
But I wasn't lost, believe me
I was right, and I've got the right
To choose my own life
Like a full circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle, life is a circle

You lost your reputation on a woman
You didn't understand or care to know
You get your education from your lovers
But now there's just no place for you to go

It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

You're set adrift with no direction
Just like a ship that's lost at sea
You don't care where you drop your anchor
Make sure it doesn't land on me

It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back
It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover
It doesn't pay to give away what you lack
You'll never get your money back

Walking around on a cloud
'Cause every girl you meet just trips on you
Saying your name out loud
I guess you met your match

She can do what she likes, it doesn't matter much
[Aide #1:]
She's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
[Aide #2:]
She filled a bull-ring, forty-five thousand seater
[Che:]
But if you're prettier than General Franco, that's not hard

[Aide #1:]
Franco's reign in Spain should see out the forties
So you've just acquired an ally who
Looks as secure in his job as you
[Aide #2:]
But more important current political thought is
Your wife's a phenomenal asset, your trump card

[Peron and Aides:]
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts

[Peron:] Will Evita win through?
[Aides:] But the answer is yes

[Peron:]
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate the actress now?

[Che:]
Now I don't like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome isn't quite as good
She hasn't gone down like they thought she would
Italy's unconvinced by Argentine glory
They equate Peron with Mussolini, can't think why

[Eva:]
Did you hear that? They called me a whore!
They actually called me a whore!

[Italian admiral:]
But Signora Peron it's an easy mistake
I'm still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago

[Aide #2:]
More bad news from Rome; she met with the Pope
She only got a rosary, a kindly word
[Che:]
I wouldn't say the Holy Father gave her the bird
But papal decorations, never a hope
[Aide #1:]
She still looked the part at St. Peter's, caught the eye

[Peron and Aides:]
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts

[Peron:] Will Evita win through?
[Aides:] But the answer is ...
[Che:] A qualified
[Aides:] Yes

[Che:]
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun through the post-war haze
A beautiful reminder of the care-free days
She nearly captured the French, she sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired

[Che:]
Face the facts, the Rainbow's starting to fade
I don't think she'll make it to England now

[Aide #1:]
It wasn't on the schedule anyhow

[Che:]
You'd better get out the flags and fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required

[Peron and Aides:]
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts

[Aide #2:] Would Evita win through?
[Aide #1:] And the answer is
[Aide #2:] Yes
[Che:] And no
[Aides:] And yes
[Che:] And no
[Aides:] And yes
[Che:] No

[Peron and Aides:]
Let's hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It's been an incredible success
We weren't quite sure, we had a few doubts

[Aides:] Would Evita win through? But the answer is
[Aide #2:] Yes
[Aide #1:] Yes
[Aide #2:] Yes

There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control (oh no)
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone

Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne

Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment

I did enjoy the ride
Don't know what to decide
You lied to me
You looked me in the eye
It took me by surprise
Now are you gratified
You cried to me

Don't turn around
'Cause you will get punched in the face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

When I was feeling down
You'd start to hang around
And then I found your hands all over me
And that was out of bounds
You filthy rotten hound
It's badder than it sounds, believe me

Don't turn around
'Cause you will get punched in the face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad I'm not sad
It's casting over

Yeah, (oh, oh), yeah yeah, oh
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high

(OK here we go) do-re-me-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti-da-so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfuckers must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with six-pack with Exacto
Knives, strangling wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

Your dreams are getting fulfilled, ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're looking sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know
Who can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods
Where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in
How they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some, get behind a Linn Drum
Make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the endin' of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer so unbelievable it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of sur-
Prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything I ain't even drinking

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creeping up on me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

I stood up, the room exploded and I knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when a door swung open and a voice said, We're glad you came
Now I've spent thousands on you darling, all the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models, bye to the clouds in the skies that all hold no rain-

All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck

Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models, bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme-

My life would be so much better, if you just dropped dead

And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much much better

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway, tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over but they let me go 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch is such a 'broad' statement and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art I say he-art
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are bitch?
Guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet

And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? I would feel so much much better

'Cause you told me you'd love me forever bitch that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea

And I'm a have a whale of a time being a single sailor
For the night, bitch on a scale of
One to ten shit I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches hoe I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (dayla)
I might hit the club find a chick that's tailor
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at these chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's 'foul' but my dick's on 'strike'
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid stupid. Wasn't for blow jobs you'd be unemployed

Man oh, man your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink oink oink

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time

Slipping through my fingers...

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile

Only tears to dwell upon

From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon

We are not there yet
We have not evolved
We have no respect
We have lost control

We're going backwards
Ignoring the realities
Going backwards
Are you counting all the casualties?

We are not there yet
Where we need to be
We are still in debt
To our insanities

We're going backwards
Turning back our history
Going backwards
Piling on the misery

We can track in all the satellites
Seeing all in plain sight
Watch men die in real time
But we have nothing inside
We feel nothing inside

We are not there yet
We have lost our soul
The course has been set
We're digging our own hole

We're going backwards
Armed with new technology
Going backwards
To a cavemen mentality

We can emulate on consoles
Killings we can control
For senses that have been dulled
Because there's nothing inside
We feel nothing inside

We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside

We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)

Because there's nothing inside

My life had been a river_x000D_
Following the same, pre-destinated course,_x000D_
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly_x000D_
With uncompromising force._x000D_
My strongholds broke down all too easily;_x000D_
I remember well,_x000D_
How it did embarrass me;_x000D_
I hung on to his every smile_x000D_
Marveled at his style

As smug as a cat_x000D_
He was handsome and smart_x000D_
Walked away with my heart_x000D_
Just like that..._x000D_
He found a temporary home in my flat_x000D_
Telling innocent lies_x000D_
Throwing dust in my eyes_x000D_

Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone_x000D_

But my secrets he learned_x000D_
Leaving no stone unturned

Following its safe and uneventful course._x000D_
Now the tears have dried,_x000D_
it's become a pleasant break,_x000D_
I recall without remorse._x000D_
But now and then_x000D_
I wonder where he is_x000D_
And I will admit,_x000D_
he had something that I miss._x000D_
I guess he was a rolling stone;_x000D_
The only one I've known.

High above the mountains, far across the sea
I can hear your voice calling out to me
Brighter than the sun and darker than the night
I can see your love shining like a light
And on and on this earth spins like a carousel
If I could travel across the world
The secrets I would tell

[Chorus:]
You and I
Were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds
We‚Äôll sail across the sky
So come with me
And you will feel
That we‚Äôre soaring
That we‚Äôre floating up so high
‚ÄòCause you and I were meant to fly

Sailing like a bird high on the wings of love
Take me higher than all the stars above
I‚Äôm burning, yearning
Gently turning round and round
I‚Äôm always rising up I never
Want to come back down

[Chorus]

Fly

You and I
Were meant to fly
Higher than the clouds
We‚Äôll sail across the sky
So come with me
And you will feel
That you and I were meant to fly

You and I were meant to fly

I got so sick of being on my own
Now the devil won't leave me alone
It's almost like I found a friend
Who's in it for the bitter end
Our consciences are always so much heavier than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time...?

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I got
Like the man I know I'm not

So sick of wasting all my time
How in God's name did I survive?
I need a little sympathy
To sore my insecurities
Our consciences are always so much heavier than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time...?

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I got
Like the man I know I'm not

(Oh oh oh, mmm)
A heavy heart on the boulevard tonight, oh
Shooting stars watch me fall apart tonight, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I got
Like the man I know I'm not

Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa)

She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

She said
What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wanna believe

That the consequences of your actions
Really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction
Taking you day by day
She says, Nothing's forever in this crazy world.
Still I'm falling in love

Jodie like to shoplift in stores
Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stops
And make love on the floor 'til the camera made us
And no woman in the world
Ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
Where she'd walk, I followed (followed)
When she left, I cried

What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?

Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

So she can hear my man awail a sax

The folks are dancing, there are all shook up

And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago,
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

Once She Had A Hollywood Audition
But The Part Was Given To A Kid

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's 3 AM, I can't sleep
Too late to call this is not like me
But I'm still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back
The angle of your chin when you were looking back

See, God you're beautiful and I'm still coming down
I'd like a one-night stand, that had to stick around
But I'm still floating from the perfume you left on my sheets
I haven't changed a thing since your goodbye to me

Tonight I stare out the window
Knowing I'll never again be alone

Last night you changed my life
And I'm stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
You saved my life
Last night you saved my life

Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It's like I knew you all my life even though we just met
My children in your eyes, something you don't expect

I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I'm glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing 'cause I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything

Last night you changed my life
(Changed my life)
And I'm stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time (first time)
Last night you saved my life with your love
You saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life with your love
(Love, love, love, love)

Last night you saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you saved my life

Oh yeah

I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun
Can't wait to tell you you're the only one

Last night you saved my life
And I'm stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
You saved my life (saved my life)
Last night you changed my life
And I'm stuck in the moment
That you kissed me the first time
Last night (last night)
You saved my life with your love (love, love, love)
You saved my life (you saved my life)

I miss your brain, the way you think
But I don't miss the way you used to drink
I miss our talks, the universal law
You had a way of seeing through my flaws
It's so confusing, I thought I met my match
An intellectual with talent, what a catch
You always said we'd be better off as friends
It was inevitable that it would end

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

I miss the countryside where we used to lay
The smell of roses on a lovely summer day
You made me laugh, you had a clever wit
I miss the good times: I don't miss all of it
You wrote me poetry, you had a way with words
You said you wanted more than just a pretty girl
Maybe I challenged you a little bit too much
We couldn't have two drivers on the clutch

Your picture's off my wall
But I'm still waiting for your call
And every man that walks through that door
Will be compared to you forevermore

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Yet I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end
I lost my very best friend
Not gonna candy coat it
And I don't want to pretend
I put away your letters
Saved the best ones that I had
It wasn't always perfect
But it wasn't always bad

Still I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I cannot lie and I won't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend
Yet I have no regrets
'Cause I survived the biggest test
I will not lie and I can't pretend
But I feel like I lost my very best friend

It's so sad that it had to end

She's on her way to work, her heart is wearing thin
The tattoos leave a mark from everywhere she's been
Cause she's never in one place, she takes it on the chin
Now tears are welling up and they are rushing down her skin
While she's pushing trough the door, she hides behind a grin
But no one really knows how sad she feels within
Life goes on, put a sad song on

She's tryna go the distance, but she's running out of love
It doesn't make a difference, no it's never quite enough
Buys chocolate bars and magazines, the things that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way back to work at 7, when the morning sun is up
She goes home at 11 with her coat all buttoned up
Buys cigarettes and DVDs, the thing that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way to nowhere

Driving in the rain to her house right up the road
Her name is on the mailbox but it never feels like home
When she's climbing into bed, you know, she's climbing all alone
When she's climbing into bed, she's climbing on her own
Life goes on, put a sad song on

She's tryna go the distance, but she's running out of love
It doesn't make a difference, no it's never quite enough
Buys chocolate bars and magazines, the things that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way back to work at 7, when the morning sun is up
She goes home at 11 with her coat all buttoned up
Buys cigarettes and DVDs, the thing that make her smile
But she falls down, down, down
She's on her way to nowhere

He's working at the bar and takes a later shift
A little drunk and far too young to end up just like this
When he takes her by the hand, she does not resist
They're on their way to nowhere because nowhere sure beats this

She's tryna go the distance, now she's got a little love
A little makes a difference, even if it's not enough
The chocolate bars and magazines, just leave 'em on the shelf
And put 'em down, down, down
She's on her way back to work at 7, when the morning sun is up
The drive home at 11 to smoke cigarettes and stuff
The DVDs and memories, you keep them to yourself
From the way down, down, down
They're on their way to nowhere

People are people
So why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully

So we're different colours
And we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you so what could I have done

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

Help me understand

Now you're punching
And you're kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fists

[Crowd:] Hello Marshall.

[Eminem:]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
Daddy look what I made, Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're lying
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying You've got one more chance to do right - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding,
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin
I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going
But baby wait,
It's too late Dad, you made the choice
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain and scream die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say..

[Chorus/Outro]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Here's another dime for you, Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman
Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman

In your ivory covered house, safe behind your walls of glass
You keep staring back at me like a memory from the past
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold you in my arms again
I know memory's not re-living

But at least it's not the end
Here's another dime for you Mr. Songman
Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can
Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman

Won't you take away the night, sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold her in my arms again

I think the whole world's crazy
I don't want to leave my bedroom
There's a devil on my shoulder
And a monster in the television
Set me up for failure
All I wanted was some options
But my only choice is living
Like time is not a crocodile but

I don't mind
I don't mind

Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
If I don't care

Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time
The gunshot has gone off
But I am swimming in a footrace
There's no finish line in sight
And they already gave the first place medal

I don't mind
I don't mind

Everything is fine and nothing matters
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
And it makes it all ok if I don't care
If I don't care

(I don't mind) (everything's alright)
(I don't mind) (everything is fine)
(I don't mind) (everything's alright)

Everything is fine and nothing matters (nothing really matters at all)
Weather's always nice inside my head
I turn my music up so loud
Tired of bullshit, drown it out
Everything is fine and nothing matters anyway
Slept through another day
And it makes it all ok if I don't care

It happened in a blink, blink, blink of a night
I guess it was the wrong, wrong side of goodbye
You caught me on the blind, blind, the blind side
You didn't even stop once to think twice

Drove through the pouring rain
Weaved in and out of pain
Wanted to turn around (turn around)
Wish I'd have done it now

I still remember how we left it that night
Said, It was better we if both just move along.
But if you're telling me it's not the last time
I'll keep a light, I'll leave a light, light on

We didn't lose the beat, beat, beat in our hearts
After falling in so deep, so hard
So if you're running 'round, 'round, 'round in the dark
I found a way to reignite the spark

Weaved in and out of pain
Wanted to turn around (turn around)

Jump in your car and just drive back to me

When we first met
You had a lot to give
I said, If I was in your shoes, I could not lose
But now, baby
I just don't know
I'm so confused
All this abuse is strange
Cause you don't act like my friend
And I can't pretend
I don't want this to end

Show some gratitude, ring my bell
Something nice to say, ring my bell
You will appreciate, ring my bell
Then you can (ring my bell)

You really have some nerve (Get it!)
Playing stupid games
Calling me names
And now
You wanna eat those words
Once you attack
You can't take it back

I guess off your high horse you're fallin'
You've callin' and callin', I don't understand at all (Come on)

Screaming
Can't hear my call

Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away

Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head

In France, a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance, his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same

At home there are seventeen year old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called 'The Disciples'
High on crack, toting a machine gun

Time, time...

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is telling you somebody died

A sister killed her baby
'Cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer
For the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

Time, time...

It's silly no, when a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly away?
But some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies, oh, why?

Baby, make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbours just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody hear the dawn?

Four in the morning, we find ourselves here
The best of us passed out, I don't know who's where
I got all my old friends and new friends I've met once before
In a blanket of smoke as we sink through the floor

Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar, ah-ah
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar, ah-ah

Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

Ooh...
Ooh, ah...

Time skips, balloon hits, I'm losing my mind
Tuesday'll be doom day, this got out of hand

Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar

Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

Ooh...
Ooh, ah...

I don't care if we're talking 'bout the same things
I don't care if we're stuck in the familiar
I don't care if we're going 'round in circles
Again, again, again

Here, here, my family
(Might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
(Not much, but all I would ask for)
Here, here, my friends and me
(Might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar
(Not much, but all I would ask for)

Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
I never felt more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near

Ooh, ah...
Ooh, ah...

When your asleep beside me, I watch you lying there
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die

Oh girl of mine you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So girl of mine turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you ... girl of mine

Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night
I wouldn't blame you darlin' if you walked out on me
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently

Oh girl of mine you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So girl of mine turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you ... girl of mine

You look at me, so differently
Have I changed so much from who I used to be?
We're both to wise, for alibis
We talk, but there's so much that we don't say
I guess I've gotten used to it this way
But in Niagara, you promised me the moon
And when I fell I couldn't tell it happened all to soon
Up in Niagara, we were foolish then
Make it happen again
You hold my hand, to please my friends
But when they leave the music stops, the love song ends
And even though I'm reaching out
It feels as though there's nothing coming in
And maybe this is how we've always been
But in Niagara, you took me by surprise
I knew you heard my every word, just looking in my eyes
But in Niagara, we were crazy then
Make me crazy again

Up in Niagara, we were crazy then
Make me crazy again...

Oooh
Oooh

Living inside my head
Pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control

Giving you all of my heart
Was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

Oooh
Oooh

Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone

Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over? Oh no

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
Oh, I don't wanna be alone

Oooh
Oooh
I don't wanna be

I've put myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why
She will not talk to me, no oh

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

Tell me what you really want

5465,Lorde,,No Better,,"
_x000D_
We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

The heart grow fonder

To make love grow

Never, never, never grow no stronger

Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (Yeah)
Sayin' I should quit (Ah)
I fuckin' tell 'em make me (Bitch)
Eat a fuckin' dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I'm turnin' back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, DIE ANTWOORD!
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout‚Äînow get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wipin' up everyone in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band
You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'Cause I knew one day (Hey!) I'm gonna be the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white

Niggas, I'm still grindin' (Yeah), I still hearin' those sirens
I'm still gettin' chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writin' more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this (For sure)

Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out (Show 'em)
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfuckin' mouth
And show me love, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (Ha-ha)
Hold you through the night (Ha-ha, right)
I just wanna love ya (We wanna love alcohol)
For the rest of my life (We wanna love guns)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (We wanna love money, ha)
Hold you through the night (We don't wanna love no bitches, though)

There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice, that's sorta unique
'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me, it's cockamanie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero uno
Assume it, there's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch

I just wanna love ya

I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night (And all the bitches say)
I just wanna love ya

I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

Niggas eatin' popcorn right, rewindin' the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape
I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose (God-damn!)
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats (Huh-uh)
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep-throat (Yeah)

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life (I love the burners, the money)
I wanna hold you in the mornin' (The bunnies, I just wanna hold you, ha-ha-ha)

Wait,
I think we're onto something,
We can't run from fate,
But we can let it take us down,
Down this road,
Where all our colors run together,
Let's take the worst and make it better,
Let's take this mess and make a home

I know it gets hard for you to stay,
But do you really want to throw it all away?
I'm thinkin'

That we could make forever after all,
Finding the gold in our darkest moments,
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses, 
And we don't ever have to leave these walls,
I'll be the boy with the silver lining,
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Oh oh ohohoh...
The girl with the cinderblock garden
Oh oh ohohoh...

Tonight,
Take all the ghosts and all those skeletons,
You hide (You hide)
Bury them deep beneath the ground,
Let them rest (Let them rest)
'Cause you weren't meant to bear that burden,
Look at the roses in your garden,
You can breathe now and forget

Forget it gets hard for you to stay,
But we don't really have to throw it all away
I'm thinkin'

That we could make forever after all,
Finding the gold in our darkest moments,
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses, 
And we don't ever have to leave these walls,
I'll be the boy with the silver lining,
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Just hold out for tomorrow,
Our dreams will follow,
Follow us back to when,
When nothing was broken,
The future was open,
Let's go back again,
Let's go again...

That we could make forever after all,
Finding the gold in our darkest moments,
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses, 
And we don't ever have to leave these walls,
I'll be the boy with the silver lining,
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

In these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smoth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind

Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons

You know that

They take their lives - destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity

Every time you leave you slam the door

You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think you're hurting me
You leave me laughing on the floor

What you say about that
You know I don't give a damn, I don't give a shit
What you say about that

You know I'm not gonna cry
About some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that

I thought we were just hanging out
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth
You thought the way you taste would get me high

You went to all your friends to brag
Guys are always such a drag
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you was to say goodbye

Oh my God
I am heartily sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of heaven and the pain of hell
But most of all, because I love thee
And I want so badly to be good

It's so hypnotic
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity right up under my feet
It's so erotic
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body, feel the heat

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

It must be the Tanqueray

My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning
You got me in the zone

Turn me on

And no one can put out my fire

When I hear them 808 drums

She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,
She works in a restaurant night and day,
She waits her life away,
She wipes her tears away.
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries

No...

Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!

Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
I can't even breathe (just lean on me),
I can't even see!
Keep your head up, don't give up, today!
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today!
All you need is love,
I tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do
Keep your head up!

Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my...

Everybody say that time is borrowed,
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance,
Fight the circumstance,
Rise and do it again

[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!

I need your love
I need you now
I need your light right here today
I need you now

Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!

Bearing witness to our darkest days

Send these, the homeless, the tempers tossed to me, to me

Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defiant often
Flying off at the handle at my mom, no dad
So I am non-compliant at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'Cause he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me
We can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
Bothers me but not my father, he said Sayonara then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They're kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryna escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dawg from a tribe called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me
We can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground on which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
'Til I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my

Legacy, legacy, eh
This is my legacy, legacy, eh
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy

When everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said It's round
He went down in history
And America was found

'Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got
Confidence

With a C and an O and an N and an F
And an I and a D and an ENCE
Put 'em all together and what have you got

Confidence

You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try

Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place

Hey!

I got a feeling inside of me
It's kinda strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why

I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around

Don't get too close it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way

Time stands still, can't explain what I feel
If this is really real, nothing's ever gonna be the same
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I get to say goodbye to the struggle in life
Say hello to the skies, spread my wings and fly away
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

Even though life's been knocking me down
I have to figure it out, see my way through the doubt
And when it seems I'm lost, turn and found my way
What I got in my hands could be the spark
Turns it all around, could this be happening now?
'Cause all my life I've waited for this day

Tell me what do you do when everyone's counting on you?
The decisions you make, the give and the take
The promises kept, and the ones that you break are the hardest to take
But, oh, we'll always be standing by you
No, I won't give up, I won't give in
'Cause the day that you run might be the day that you win

Even when life's knocking you down
You always figure it out, see your way through the doubt
And when you're lost I help you find your way
What you got in your hands could be the spark
Turns it all around, is this happening now?
'Cause all my life I've knew we'd see this day
I knew we'd see this day
I knew we both would see this day

You know all your dreams are calling
On this day
It's out there if you want it
Don't be afraid
Believe and know your best is yet to come
'Cause all my life I've waited for this day

Waiting for this day (We've been waiting so long)
Waiting for this day (Oh)
Waiting for this day
Waiting for this day (Is the present the gift)
Waiting for this day (Or is the present the day?)
Waiting for this day (Oh, oh)

And when those blue melodies start callin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
It seems plain to me

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago,
They still make me blue

They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

We sat by the fire
United in song
Under the moonlight
All night long

We sang 'Hallelujah'
For the joy of it all

And out on the water
A caroling loon
Sings us a sweet
Heavenly tune

There's peace in God's forest
The temple of life

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah

And back in the city
I'm losing control
I need a place
To ease my soul

There's peace in God's temple
The temple of life

We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes

Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him

In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely, heavy cross I must bear
Then he tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trustworthy
He gives me strength far more than my share

Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him

_x000D_
Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I, stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood

Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I can see is grief and gloom, till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space

Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free, bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood
"
2543,Barbra Streisand,2012,Lost In Wonderland,compilation: Release Me,"
_x000D_
I'm all alone in a place I have never been.
I see a door to a garden and wander in.
And though my journey has barely begun
I am spun like a top to the top of the universe and
High in a spiral of ice I gaze upon a scene
That flickers far below me.
And what I see is a crinkle of colors and sounds.
Colors and sounds.

I can hear tinkles of crystal
and I can see sparkles of mist on the spangles
And I can feel tangles of tingles and sprinklings of angles
And inklings of angels around.

A rabbit crosses my path unexpectedly.
I hear a sigh of despair as he passes me.
I have a feeling that rabbit is late
For wherever he's going whatever he's headed for is my destination.
Oh, show me the way to stay here in this world
Because here's where the right things happen.
Oh baby here's where the good things are.

Looking at this enormous butterfly,
Wondering if he cares to dance with me.
Delicate as a flower carved of chrysophrase,
Idly I ponder how far have I yet to find it.
I've got to find it and act as though I've lost it.
Otherwise I'm lost in wonderland.

I've got to find it or else I am bound
To the empty ground bleak and vast.
Where dark spells are cast.

Flooring above me and ceiling below me
And chandeliers rising like tremulous towers
And tables and chairs and beds hanging like blossoms
In turquoise and purple and green.

You were asleep so I guess you were not aware,
I took a walk through your mind and I lingered there.
But what I found I can never reveal to you
Not with my voice nor the pitch of my flute recall it.
You'll simply have to come walking with me
One day into that wonderland shining behind your eyes,
Beyond the gossamer doors of sleep.
Just sleep...

All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

The more you love, the more it hurts
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over

In your head, in your heart
Turn it up, make it stop
Tonight, all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

Is a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, we almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade, for every broken heart tonight

All the love that we made
Turn it up, let it play

A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade

Somedays I look,
I look at you with eyes that shine.
Somedays I don't,
I don't believe that you are mine.

It's no good asking me what time of day it is,
Who won the match or scored the goal.
Somedays I look,
Somedays I look into your soul.

Sometimes I laugh,
I laugh to think how young we were.
Sometimes it's hard,
It's hard to know which way to turn.

Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall,
How much it cost or what it's worth.
Sometimes I laugh,
I laugh to think how young we were.

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real.
Inside each one of us is love,
And we know how it feels.

Somedays I cry,
I cry for those who live in fear.
Somedays I don't,
I don't remember why I'm here.

No use reminding me, it's just the way it is,
Who ran the race and came in first.
Somedays I cry,
I cry for those who fear the worst.

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real.
Inside each one of us is love,
And we know how it feels.

Somedays I look,
I look at you with eyes that shine.
Somedays I don't,
I don't believe that you are mine.

It's no good asking me what time of day it is,
Who won the match or scored the goal.
Somedays I look,
Somedays I look into your soul.

Look at the pavement
Our initials barely fit
I used an old nail
While you kept the night lit

See, I don't like this
I think I might just
Kick the dramatics
So watch out...

'Cause I don't want you to leave
I want a day in your dreams
And with a little luck you can stay
A little luck you can stay, a little luck you can stay
'Cause I don't want you to leave

Now I'm sitting at a table for one
Now I'm sitting at a table for one

Hey, why the long face?
You little night owl
I'm just an early riser
Still you woke up with that face, wow!

See, I don't like this
I think I might flip
Kick the dramatics
So watch out...

'Cause I don't want you to leave
I want a day in your dreams
And with a little luck you can stay
A little luck you can stay, a little luck you can stay
'Cause I don't want you to leave

Now I'm sitting at a table for one
Now I'm sitting at a table for one

Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me
Blue summer blood, blue summer love
Blue summer, don't take me

'Cause I don't want you to leave
('Cause I don't want you to leave
'Cause I don't want you to leave)
I want a day in your dreams
(I want a day in your dreams
I want a day in your dreams)
And with a little luck you can stay
(A little luck you can stay
A little luck you can stay)
'Cause I don't want you to leave
('Cause I don't want you to leave
'Cause I don't want you to leave)

Blue summer, don't take me

Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S. O. S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S. O. S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?

Forgive me for the things
That I never said to you
Forgive me for not knowing
The right words to say, to prove

That I will always be
Devoted to you and me
And if you can't feel that in my love
Then I'm sorry for not giving you enough

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way it made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
'Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

And I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Well, maybe there've been times
That I let you down
Looking back on all those moments
I know that I should have found

Love is to be for you
And now I will promise to you
And if you don't see that in my eyes
Then I'll be
Sorry for the rest of my life

But I'm not sorry for my love
I'm not sorry for my touch
The way it made your hands
Tremble and my heart rush

I would do it all again
Wouldn't take back a thing, no
Cause with you I've lived
A thousand lives in one

But I could never be
I could never be
Sorry for love

Aren't we all make mistakes
No matter how hard we try
But hearts can't only break
When sorry comes all around

OOh, when sorry comes around

I'm not sorry...
For my love
For my touch

I would do it all again
I wouldn't take back my love

Because with you I've lived
A thousand lives into one
But I could never be
I could never be
I could never be
I could never be

Sorry for love

Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time
Very long ago

Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go

Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again

Once upon a time
Never comes again

I've only got three dollars left in my hands
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel
I'm living in at a fancy hotel, yeah, yeah
Then I'll go up to my room
Fixate on what's the deal
I'm alone again
Then I will crawl into the bed
And call you up to tell you off

'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone?
Before I lose my mind
'Cause you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go tonight
Yeah, yeah, let go
Hey, yeah, oh oh

I'll probably wake up a little sad
But then I'll get up and let go of it all instead
'Cause really it's not worth it
To get in a mess over him
To bother get stressed over him
So I'll just go on with my life
And fixate on everything else but you
Yea I'll just go on with my life
I have no reason to please you anymore

'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go

So find your way out of my sight
I know it's hard, it's tough to laugh
It's all messed up, don't play this game

'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y
If I let you go tonight, if I let you go

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself, I'm here again
All by myself, you know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

Dare they happen to meet Leroy Kincaid

Cutting out a different path
Led by your beating heart

All the people of the town
Cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart

The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path upon the ground
You ran into the night you can‚Äôt be found

But this is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Summer evening breezes blew
Drawing voices deep from you
Led by your beating heart

What a year and what a night
What terrifying final sights
Put out your beating heart

The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path upon the ground
You ran into the night you can‚Äôt be found

But this is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

If you had your gun would you shoot it at the sky?
Why? To see where it would fall
Oh will you come down at all?
If you had your gun would you shoot it at the sky?

And the world thought I'd had it all
But I was waiting for you

Oh it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun

A new day has come

Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness I found my strength

Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real
I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams

Mmm yeah, yeah

D.M.C. we have a mid 30s male
Found down unresponsive
Possible overdose
Substance unknown
Pulse is 60 and thready
Respiration's 8 he's intubated
And we're bagging him now
Uuh B.P. 90 over palp
Patient cool pale and diaphoretic
Has aspirated
Uuh G.S.C. is 3
We'll update en route
E.T.A. 10 minutes

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face... Mommy, something is wrong with dad, I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat.

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like d√©j√† vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why? I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I've been sober a fucking year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fucking hear
Marshall, come on, we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half-buzzed for half of the time
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball
Shit must have knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?
Man fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
Shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?
All systems ready for take off, please, stand by

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like d√©j√† vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why? I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self-inducing a snooze
What else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?
Now here I am three months later full-blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambien each nap how many Valium? Three
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
OK, so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years to just put out an album beat
See me and you we almost had the same outcome heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing
It was Bologna was it the methadone ya think
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases with your Ambient CR great places to hide 'em, ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie
I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor... Damn

Sometimes I feel so alone
I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold
It's like something takes over me
Soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like d√©j√† vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense
Go in, and gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A., Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Surprises let me know she cares

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Auf Dem Wasser zu Singen. It is really one of my

So much fun to sing...Why don't you join in with me
For the last chorus and..er...you know, sing along with

See you get this wet
'Till you're lost in the deep end
Swimmin' in lust
You must have missed the part
Where I said it's a good thing 'til it's not
Oh my God, we fell apart

I'm the party poison
At your pity parade

Like a junkie outta luck
Like it's all a bit too much
Chalk it up to our love
Let me stress it

I'm a fool for you
There's nothing I won't do for you
Tell me, is it good for you
Was it all too good to be true, to be true (to be true)

Hola! Ese bato loco!

I'm going bananas
And I feel like my poor little mind is being devoured by piranhas
For I'm going bananas
I'm non compos mentes
And I feel like a tooth being drilled, a nerve being killed by a dentist
For I'm non compos mentes

Who knows?
Could be the tropic heat
Or something that I eat
That makes me gonzo
I do carry on so, for I'm going bananas
Someone book me a room in the hot haciendo with all my mananas
For I'm going bananas

I'm going meshuga
All day long there's a man in my brain incessantly playing Booga wooga
But I'm going meshuga

There's bats in my belfry
Won't you make sure this straightjacket's tight
Otherwise I might get myself free
Yes, there's bats in my belfry

Who knows?
Could be the wine I drink
Or it's the way I think
That makes me gonzo
Oh, Doctor Alonzo says I'm going bananas
Someone get me a bed in the Casa de Loco for all my mananas
For I'm going bananas
Yes, I'm going bananas
Si, I'm going bananas

A cozy morris chair
What kind of chair
Is a morris chair?
One caress, happiness,
Seems to bless my little honey
I love him more each day
When years have passed away
He'll find my love
Belongs to him only!
'Cause when the world seems wrong
He'll know that I belong
Right in my honey's loving arms

I love him more each day

The old home town looks the same,
As I step down from the train,
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all be there to meet me,
All creatures smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

The old house is still standing,
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's an old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Then I awake and look around me
Cold gray walls surround me
And I realize that I was only dreamin'
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home

Yes, they'll all be there to meet me
In the shadow of that old oak tree
As they lay me beneath the green, green grass of home

Of love's eternal glory

Spreading the news around the world
Taking the word to boys and girls

When she wants you under her spell.
The sight of her tears drives you out of your mind,

I had my love as perfect as could be.
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried,
And it was all for me.

Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart?

Oh, my man, I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair, but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, all right...
What's the difference if I say I'll go away
When I know I'll come back on my knee someday
For whatever my man is, I am his forever more...

[Brian Matthew:] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
[Paul:] We don't think so, really.
[Brian:] You don't ever think that?
[Paul:] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbing about you, which you get often.
[John:] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids.
[Brian:] Now, what do you, eh, well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
[John:] No, she knows I'm not divorced, 'cause I keep seeing her every day, you see.
[Brian:] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh--
[Paul:] Like riding a bus?
[Brian:] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
[Paul:] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things.
[John:] We go to certain ones.
[George:] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, 'cause they pretend they don't know us.

Once I stood in the night
With my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as could be
And my heart felt alone and I cried oh Lord
Don't hide your face from me

Like a king I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing
In this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone
Hold my hand all the way, every hour every day
From here to the great unknown

Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone

Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone

To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen

They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They lie and they dine in their blood
Two timing slim
Who's ever heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you'd do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you

You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, Beware doll, you're bound to fall
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal

How does it feel?

To be without a home
Like a complete unknown

But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home

They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own

Who is the master? Who is the slave?

Waiting for your answer
Is a kind of torture
Could I grow accustomed to this kind of hell?

Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new
Are you out of control?
Is that dog walking you?
Haven't you had enough?
Now your time is up
Baby, show me your hand

[Madonna:]
Voices start to ring in your head
Tell me what do they say
Distant echoes from another time
Start to creep in your brain
So you claim madness
Like it's convenient
You do it so often that you start to believe it
You have demons so nobody can blame you
But who is the master and who is the slave?

[Madonna:]
First you say you love me
Then you wanna leave me
Then you say you're sorry
You play the game so well
I bought your illusion
You're the greatest salesman
How could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself?

[Madonna:]
Are you walking the dog?
'Cause that dog isn't new

Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Cos my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned
Has overturned
I beg of you...

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and, baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied
I skip my pride
I beg you, dear...

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned
Has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

I add two and two, the most simple addition,
Then swear that the figures are lying,
I'm a much better comic than mathematician
'Cause I'm better on stage than at intermission,
And as far as the man is concerned,
If I've been burned,
I haven't learned.
I know he's around when the sky and the ground start in ringing,
I know that he's near by the thunder I hear in advance,
His words--his words alone--are the words that can start my heart singing,
And his is the only music that makes me dance.

He'll sleep and he'll rise, in the light of two eyes that adore him.
Bore him it might, but he won't leave my sight for a glance.
In ev'ry way, ev'ry day, I need less of myself and need more him--more him,
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance,
'Cause his is the only music that makes me dance.

[Michael Jackson:]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself: how did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone... lone lone why lone

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart

And angels sing

Another year over, a new one just begun
And so this Christmas, I hope you had fun
Near and the dear ones, the old and the young

Let's hope it's a good one, without any fear

And so this is Christmas, for weak and for strong
For rich and the poor ones, the world is so wrong
So happy Christmas, for black and for white!
For yellow and red ones! Let's stop all the fight!

A very merry Christmas, and a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear

And so this Christmas, what have we done?
Another year over, a new one just begun
And so happy Christmas, we hope you had fun

Some say it was radiation, some say there was acid on the microphone
Some say a combination that turned their hearts to stone
But whatever it was, it drove them to their knees
Oh, Legionnaire's disease

I wish I had a dollar for everyone that died within that year
Got 'em hot by the collar, plenty an old maid shed a tear
Now within my heart, it sure put on a squeeze
Oh, that Legionnaire's disease

Granddad fought in a revolutionary war, father in the War of 1812
Uncle fought in Vietnam and then he fought a war all by himself
But whatever it was, it came out of the trees
Oh, that Legionnaire's disease

One lovely, pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be OK, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

I used to think that we'd reunite
I'd be your wife, in the real life
I thought that you'd come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever

This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I'm frozen in time, in time, in time

Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy you'll be young forever
I'll be over here, you'll be over there
I'ma shed a tear but I really don't care
Frozen in time, always be mine

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh

If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, It's nice to meet ya.
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness,
I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh

Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Sing!

Don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile

If you relax and just enjoy it all
Life has got to be a ball

This is living
Full of fun and free
This is living
That's the life for me

It wouldn't mean a thing
If I could be a king
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got

This is living

This is living

Don't wanna settle down
I gotta move around
I gotta lot of time

The kind who feels the way I do

But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times, I drew from her
But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her
Plus the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her
Then I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her
Tell her, It's a butt-dial girl, yeah, booty call (Haha)
That's how it used to be, 'cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (Fifty)
Fuck, I miss them days

You used to be my favorite bitch
Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through and complain
That I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'll be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I had to bounce on my favorite bitch

You fuckin' leavin' me, bitch?
I don't think so, sit your motherfuckin' ass down
I swear to God, you run to that door
I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head
I'ma ask you this one time
The answer better be, Yes

Would you marry me again?
Now that everything is changed (Yeah)
It'll never be the same (Nah)
As the era whence we came (Who?)
From Nas to Pac, Rak' (Yeah), Eric B. and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo! MTV Raps (Yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode
The feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape
You hold and peel it back, yeah
Tear it off, then play it (What?)
I swear to God, four o'clock
We'd crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks
When Nani was Kon Artis (Yeah) and Proof had his hair in locs (Doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearing clocks
(Back when) Back when Ed Lover (Yeah)
When there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (Pair of Docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't wanna stop (Yeah) 'til I get you back
'Cause I gotta put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
Other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (Ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped your mind, you must be biding your time
Looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully, it was never really you and me exclusively
And there's too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through
Bet they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can
Hear me? I used to be your favorite, bitch

Que sera demain nos destins plus loin?
Un peu de paix d'amour et de pain
Au creux de tes mains

What'll be tomorrow our destins far away

A little of peace of love and of bread

In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said

At the dawning of the day
I can't bear to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you now
It's taken all of my strength
But I'm stronger now

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again

Love is lost, where is it to be found?
My heart is still here
Do we have to go round and round?
And all the time I was loving you faithfully
And you took my love, and you turned it around on me

Now I don‚Äôt wanna fight with you
I‚Äôve done everything I can do
Don‚Äôt you leave me like that
I just want my girl back
Can we work it out?, or was it over ?

What are we doing? [x2]
Why can‚Äôt we seem to work things out?

Did we forget what love was about?

But now I realize
We are just better not together

It‚Äôs hard to let go
Girl we‚Äôve been through so many things
But for you to grow
You have to go and spread your wings
I see your tears
You are searching for a brighter day
And you should have thought it through
When you gave my love away

Now I don‚Äôt wanna fight with you
I‚Äôve done everything I can do
I hate to leave you like that
But I thought you had my back
We tried to work it out, but it‚Äôs over

What are we doing? [x2]
Why cant we seem to work things out? (Was you and me together)
What are we doing [x2]
Did we forget what love was about?
Feels like I‚Äôm losing [x2]
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

Girl it‚Äôs just too much for me to say
You to tell me that you love me
And then to watch you walk away
But girl the way we fight
It just ain‚Äôt right
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better this way (Yeah yeah yeah)
Now no what else to say
But girl you know that
I still love you
yeahhhhh

What are we doing?
Why cant we seem to work things out?

To come downstairs and open the door?

For all the time lost since I blew up
And became the man that drops his pants and every girl around the world is dying to love
Break the beat down, let me tell you what I'm talking about
If you're not careful, it'll turn you out
It's that way she used to go when you want it nice and slow
Even though you can't, the memory will make you want some more
She used to understand me, touch me, hold me
Taught me how to be a man
She used to kiss me, all them things she used to show me
Damn, I wish that I could do it again

She was a friend of the fam, hot without the glam, not
When I be tripping, she didn't really give a damn, stop

If I keep on thinking about that back and I'm gonna be right back in it

[Che:]
High flying, adored
So young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing, of all the talents
A cross between a fantasy of the bedroom and a saint
You were just a backstreet girl
Hustling and fighting, scratching and biting

High flying, adored
Did you believe in your wildest moments
All this would be yours
That you'd become the lady of them all?

Were there stars in your eyes
When you crawled in at night
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall

High flying, adored
What happens now, where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now
Nothing can thrill you, no one fulfill you

High flying, adored
I hope you come to terms with boredom
So famous so easily, so soon
It's not the wisest thing to be

You won't care if they love you
It's been done before
You'll despair if they hate you
You'll be drained of all energy
All the young who've made it would agree

[Eva:]
High flying, adored
That's good to hear but unimportant
My story's quite usual
Local girl makes good, weds famous man

Filled a gap, I was lucky
But one thing I'll say for me
No one else can fill it like I can

Said now don't you worry, we're in the Lord's hands
He's gonna walk beside us, the time is comin' near
He's gonna wash away all our misery and our fear

I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day

You got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out

Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo
And grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

They holler at me but it's you
You, this ain't high school

But fuck me like a husband

Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will

Now I know that it can easily happen
To someone like me
I don't want to step on anybody's toes

Who knows how to find love
Think before you give your answer
Who knows what a mystery may bring

Once in a life I'm a lucky man
If I can find the kind of love
That's gonna last for me

Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows when a mystery begins

I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

Twice in a lifetime
Is one of those unspoken dreams
We usually reserve for fantasy

Who knows how we find love
Stop before you give your answer
Who knows when a mystery begins

I know, I know
I know because it's happening to me
I know, I know

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss him

To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are
You are
You are my everything
You are
You are
You are my everything

I know you're not far but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you and I know sorry ain't the cure
If I cross your mind just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are...

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away

You are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are my everything

I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently; you're just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough 'cause we are just gonna be
Enemies as long as we breathe, I don't ever see
Either of us comin' to terms where we can agree
There ain't gonna be no reasonin' speakin' with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak-a Ingl√©s
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin', unless
You're gonna agree to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face-to-face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me that you've never seen
And you're gonna see this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need 15 of my homies
When I see you, I'm seein' you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me! Pick me up, throw me!
Lift me up, hold me‚Äîjust like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too

To hurt your focus, you's not MC's

In two-thousand-third: you's perpin'
You's no threat, who's you servin'?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseein' the Earth
Shady, motherfucker, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse
Is he who depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use a vest
Before tools choose your rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth

Now go to sleep, bitch! Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close your eyes!
Go to sleep, bitch! (What!) Why are you still alive?
How many times I gotta say, close your eyes!

Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be_x000D_
Something that's crossed over from another century ?

Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth_x000D_
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth_x000D_
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth_x000D_
Something there is about you that brings back a long forgotten truth.

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings_x000D_
Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things_x000D_
I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath_x000D_
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.

You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
One accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way

That life can change, that you're not stuck in vain

But you're sure you could be right

And the embers never fade in your city by the lake

So believe, believe in me, believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now

Cause I believe there's not a chance tonight

We'll make it right, we'll feel it all tonight

Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door

Love is funny, or it's sad,
Or it's quiet, or it's mad
It's a good thing, or it's bad,
But beautiful . . .
Beautiful to take a chance,
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinkin'
I wouldn't mind at all . . .
Love is tearful, or it's gay,
It's a problem, or it's play
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful . . .
And I'm thinkin' if you were mine,
I'd never let you go,
And that would be just beautiful I know
Beautiful to take a chance,
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinkin'
I wouldn't mind at all . . .
Love is tearful, or it's gay,
It's a problem, or it's play
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful . . .
And I'm thinking if you were mine
I would never let you go!
And that would be so beautiful. . . .
Yes, that would be but beautiful . . .

I see the one, 'cause she be that lady! Hey!

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

[Chorus (2x):]
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'til you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Ooh...Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a little drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me and she's like You're!
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing

And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rolling'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing D!
Hitting no less than Three!

And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day: his name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that! (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (Hi, Bob!)
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, Knock it off!
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it‚Äîit's bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy‚Äîit's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (But umm‚Ä¶)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)
(Uh, the fart button's on) [*fart*] (Ew, ahh!)
La la la (So fucked up right now)

On the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
I've seen and I've done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
I'd be on that train tomorrow
I'll be home on Christmas day

And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh, too many tears fell
My soul fills with yearning
If I had sense at all
I'd just be on my way
Be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day

Everytime I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And I'd be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day

If I had any sense at all
I'd just be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day
I said I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day

I know you've been dreaming 'bout the times in our lives
But I've been screaming in my bed late at night
A space a little, little and your stack of pain
Makes it grip that skull, to me child that you'll stay
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay

Just another Sunday
Just another Sunday
Oh yaaa, just another Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa

There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend
'Cos hearts don't always share love, or the person on the other
End
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya

Just another Sunday yaa
Just another Sunday oh baby
It's only one more Sunday
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa

Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me
'Cos felling the same pain makes half the luxury
Take a walk away won't end the carousel
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue
There's something I need to say before it's to late
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay

Just another Sunday yaa
Just another Sunday oh baby
It's only one more Sunday
Just another Sunday
It's just another Sunday
It's just another
Just another Sunday
Just another oh yaa

It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
Mmmh and another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

Mmmh, that's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on (Ride on)
Standing on the edge of the road (Ride on)
Thumb in the air (Ride on)
One of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
'Till then I'll just keep riding on

Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street
And I ain't too old to hurry
'Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

But I'm lonely
Lord, I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?

(Ride on, ride on)
Got myself a one-way ticket (Ride on, ride on)
Goin' the wrong way (Ride on)
Gonna change my evil ways
...One of these days
One of these days

(Ride on, ride on)
I'm gonna ride on (Ride on)
Mmmh, lookin' for a truck (Ride on)
Mmm-hm, keep on riding
Ridin' on and on and on and on and on and on and on
(Ride on, ride on)
Gonna have myself a good time (Ride on)
Mmm, yeah (Ride on)

And my feet are bare
Haven't washed my hair

Don't mean you're losing

Fall right on my face

My body's filling with my regret and sorrow
Gloomy symphonies fill my head

Tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
To cleanse me of your memory and mend me when you're gone
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song
And maybe when I play it in my room
I won't feel so empty when I'm thinking about you
I can feel we're barely holding on
So tonight I think I'll write the saddest song

Maybe you'll be on your way to work
And hear it when you're driving down the street
And maybe then you'll wanna make things work
And tell me that you never wanna leave

(Gonna come out now
Ha ha ha
Wow look out.)

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer

And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job

She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?

_x000D_
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (things different)
'Cause it was such a dumb-ass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got‚Ä¶ thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda led to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin' still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard Mockingbird
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, back-stabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father

Creo entender que los sue√±os son infiel
Al morir no son m√°s que confites why papel
Es el tiempo pasado why en los a√±os que vendr√°n
Quien podr√° predecir que depara el porvenir
Que nos falta por vivir

Felicidad, felicidad
Al brindar les deseamos de ahora en m√°s
Paz, amor en donde reine la amistad
Felicidad, felicidad
Al rogar esperanza de cambiar
Sin dejar al desaliento dominar
Why as√≠, triunfar

You went to school to learn boy
Things you never ever knew before

Sit yourself down and take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

ABC, easy as 123
All simple as Do, Re, Mi
ABC, 123, baby you and me, boy

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of a learning tree
But listen without the roots of love everyday
Boy, your education ain't complete

How to get an A (how to get an A)
Spell me and you and add the two
Listen to me baby
That's all you gotta do

ABC, easy as 123
All simple as Do, Re, Mi

Shake it, shake it, baby [x3]

Get out my way
Just step aside, or pay the price

What I want, I take
What I don't, I break
And I don't want you
With a flick (of) my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do

Make my stand, no man's land
On my own
Man in blue, it's up to you

What I want, I stash
What I don't, I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive

And I never miss

Just runnin' wild

Just watch your step

Street alight
I drink my booze
Some run, some fight
But I win, they lose

What I need, I like
What I don't, I fight
And I don't like you
Say, Bye, bye while you're still alive

Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Raw raw like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

The streets been telling me to get on the remix right?!
Heh heh ha ha ha ha ha ha! Let's get it!

[Nicki Minaj:]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is lagging
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been?
Yeah I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
Ha ha... plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki! Asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars ‚Äì sentencing

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho ‚Äì punt!
Forced trauma ‚Äì blunt
You play the back, bitch I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it
Nicki Minaj, is who you ain't fucking with
You lil' Fraggle Rock
Beat you with a pad lock
I am a movie, camera block

You out of work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Aiyo somebody go get a thermostat and check my temperature
I feel like a got a fever in this muh'fucker!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Nicki! How you gon' take my hot line and make it a hot song

Like I ain't 'posed to come and step on this shit like King Kong!
See as a child I was born with a old soul
See I would breathe heavy flame would shoot out of my nose hole
Ha rah! Too much shitty diapers
Love to play with matches and drink all the fluid out of lighters
From when I was a child I know that most of y'all was triddash
I dig in my nose and wipe the biggest booger on your bitch ass!
Using your head like fuck what the Lord said
Slightly demented with a permanent wrinkle in my forehead
Boar's Head beef bitch if you want it then peep lane
Murder niggas with the fire then bounce to a Heat game
Tie you up like bikes to a rail in with a little cheap chain
And I'll comfortably hang you from the side of the building
So niggas see your bitch ass is lame!
Aiyyo what you cut it off for? Don't you see what I'm doing to this?!
'Posed to know how I'm directing these flicks
The question everywhere is You getting on the remix? (damn right!)
'Cause this is something that I fathered and mastered
And plastered 'til they started calling me sick bastard
I'm drastic when it comes to reminding niggas who's responsible for the classics
And I burn a hole in the street like a nigga was acid
Every time I jump on the beat see the shit will get drastic
While you getting yo' ass kicked
Like a kick and a punch slap and two chops
Kinda like pong ping baduf baf beat him until he diggity 2Pac
Mi broke mi ting leave a few match
Rope him and then drag him a few blocks (horrible)
Uh! Uh! Uh! The muscle of the street (move bitch)
Pardon me uh! Shuffling the beat nigga!
Uh! Take a elbow, I'm scuffling to eat
Like a nigga that was grinding and was hustling for weeks
So I rushed and rushed, then I blacked
Then I came through and I gave the streets crack
Controlling the functions throughout the steer
Everybody put your motherfucking hands in the air!
(That's how I do 'em)
I do the type of shit that niggas can't imagine (Uh huh!)
You know I'm one of the nicest and I ain't bragging (Uh huh!)
I make 'em all surrender 'til they see white flags
And they recognize I'm the original dungeon dragon (OK!)
Raw raw like a dungeon dragon
Change your shitty drawers 'cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this and I'll twist you to a turban
And have you smelling rank like some old stale urine

Gone!

But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me going: Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!

See I met her at club on a Friday
Big booty, small waist
Seen her comin' my way
So I had to bag her
I really had to have her (oh-ooh)
I didn't see a ring on her finger
Asked her did you ever been with a singer before
She said no (oh-ohh)
So let me introduce you to my world
These diamonds and pearls all of part of being my girl

Cause we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
Like we don't care
Makes me want to keep grindin'
Like we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me goin'... Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!

[Bridge:]
We dancin' together like we belong in my bedroom
(In and out the sheets what we doin' it on the dance floor)
If we shared mattresses you'd leave me no head room
(Loose as one can be and she's flaunting it, damn it's hardcore)

[Chorus:]
People are watching!
We don't care
The way I'm touching your body
Cause we don't care
See you droppin' and poppin'
But we don't care
Makes me want to keep grindin'
But we don't care (oh-ooh)
See I'm gettin' nasty
With you on the dance floor
You got me going... Oh-Oooh!
Could you be the reason why I'm losing control
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!
Fo Sho! Like we don't care!

Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on, but I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go (alone)

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Incomplete

Shadows falling baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye

[Barry:]
Aaah!
Pulse's racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
(It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
(It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million

I don't wanna hear your

And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million

Don't wanna hear your goodbye
Don't wanna hear your

There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties_x000D_
Stood up and started to see stars_x000D_
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars_x000D_
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck_x000D_
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck_x000D_
But I think somebody seen me maybe_x000D_
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby_x000D_
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits_x000D_

The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded

So lost, I'm faded

So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea, I'm breathing
Alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You've set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?

It's these substandard motels on the (la, la, la, la, la) corner of 4th and Fremont Street.
Appealing only 'cause they are just that un-appealing
Any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering.
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe just a dash of formaldehyde,
And the habit of decomposing right before your very (la, la, la, la) eyes.

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Tonight tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday.
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money.
Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy.

Yeah, yeah.

And not to mention the constable and his proposition, for that virgin
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on strictly business
As he said to the Mrs.
Well, only hours before,
After he had left, she was fixing her face in a compact.
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag,
And held a purse of a different kind.

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

There are no raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses.
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things.

[Act II opens with the newly wed Fanny and Nick
arriving at their home in Long Island. Fanny's
friends have prepared a surprise party for them.
Ziegfeld is there, hoping Fanny will be in his new
show; he's even hired her friend Eddie as dance
director. Fanny's Ziegfeld friends ask her what
it's like be married and she replies:]

[Fanny:]
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
Bow when I go by.
I'm a corporation now,
Not me, myself and I.
Oh how that marriage license works
On chambermaids and hotel clerks.
The honeymoon was such delight
That we got married that same night.
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
Still in bed at noon,
Racking my brain deciding
Between orange juice and prune.
Nick says nothing is too good for me,
And who am I not to agree?
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady, that's me!
[All:]
She's Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Fanny:]
Meet a mortgagee,
[All:]
The owner of an icebox
[Fanny:]
With a ten-year guarantee.
Oh, sit me in the softest seat,
Quick, a cushion for my feet.
Do for me, buy for me, lift me, carry me,
Finally got a guy to marry me!
I do my nails,
Read up on sales,
All day the records play.
Then he comes home, I tell him
Oy--what a day I had today!
I swear I'll do my wifely job,
Just sit at home--become a slob!
I'm Sadie, Sadie, married lady, that's me!
[All:]
She's Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Boys:]
Sadie, you did the trick.
[Fanny:]
It's nothing!
[Girls:]
Not ev'ry girl can get herself
A guy who looks like Nick.
[Fanny:]
Wait, to tell the truth, it hurt my pride--
The groom was prettier than the bride.
[All:]
Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Fanny:]
Husband, house, a mortgage, a baby,
[All:]
Sadie, Sadie, married lady,
[Fanny:]
That's who?
[All:]
That's you.

That's me--married lady.

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em

[Taylor]
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it

Tonight I saw an eclipse of your smile
Within my own reflection on you look
So beautiful then
A tear ran down my face
And all my memories erase
Oh, why you have to leave my side

Oh why do all the rivers flow into the ocean
And why does all the love in the world
Comes strait from the heart
And why does all the pain I feel
Come from deep inside
Oh all those questions
I could have answered
If you were were by my side

Something made me look at you
Something made me do what I had to do, girl
Something made me talk to you
Something made me do what I should do
I want you by my side
(I want you by my side, I want you by my side)

Now everyday the pain I feel
Slowly fades away
And all the memories of you and me
Are always here to stay
What I'm asking girl is one more chance
To let me in your life
Oh could if you give me one more chance
Than I could be right by your side

When all you can do
Is turn back around
Walk over your footprints
To what you've already found
And crawl through the pieces
That you left on the ground

Cause everything is there
But its too close and it's too much
It's not the fear of letting go
But it's the fear of losing love
And that's just how the story goes
As you watch your life unfold
Now what you have is what you had
And now its gone, your on your own

Every time I try to walk away...This nightmare
Adrenaline pulsing through my veins...Brings me there
For every little thing that we do
No I can't forget, I can't forget its you
No I won't forget you...

No I never wanted
To Leave things like this
I put up these walls
So you can't see in
But inside I'm dying
I want to let you in

Cause everything is there, but its too close and it's too much
It's not the fear of letting go, but it's the fear of losing love

Every time I try to walk away...This nightmare
Adrenaline pulsing through my veins...Brings me there
For every little thing that we do
No I can't forget, I can't forget its you
No I won't forget you...

I won't, I won't forget you
I won't, no I won't forget you
Just slow down, just slow down
Just, slow down, just slow down
Slow down, and hold on...

Every time I try to walk away...This nightmare
Adrenaline pulsing through my veins...Brings me there
For every little thing that we do
No I can't forget, I can't forget its you

I can't find my love
No matter how hard I try
She's giving me the runaround
Makes me want to lay down and cry

Come on back to me right now
'Cos you don't have to stay away
I don't play no hide and seek
It's not a game I want to play

Traveling around the world
Trying to find a perfect mate
I found myself a little girl
But now she's started running away

Come on back to me right now
Don't wait til they unleash the hounds
If you don't get back today
They'll follow your trail and hunt you down

I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked since I was born
Born to follow you wherever you go
But my problem is I never do know
Where you're taking me I don't have a clue
I've been naked since I was born

Save my soul and set it free
Free to fly home
There's a place I'm meant to be
Back, back home

I've been broken in so many places
Put together by a sea of faces
What to make of them I don't hardly know
I've been naked for so long, so long

I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked for so long
I've been naked for so long
So long, so long now

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people living life in peace

With skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of a rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of the people strolling by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
I think they're really saying, I love you

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Oh, I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They will learn much more
Than I'll never know
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think it could be
Such a wonderful world

Imagine
Oh, imagine
Oh, just imagine

Another night on the north shore?
Do you even want to see my face again?
I'm a waste of chances,
Full of bad romances,
Your favorite enemy,
And your most hated friend.

You wonder if it's worth it.
But when it works it works,
When it's broke it's perfect.

Don't you ever let me go,
I know your heart is shut, shut, shut.
And don't you know,
Nothing's gonna change us.

And you like me just the way I'm not.

You're a classic case of,
Foolish, young and in love,
But you don't even know what love could do to us.
We are brash and reckless,
Made of glass and careless,
We break apart the moment we both feel too much.

'Cause when it hurts it hurts,
You wonder if it's worth it.
But when it works it works,
When it's broke it's perfect.

keep spinning on the wheel of time

may colour what we see ahead
but our lives are strong together

And had no fear or sense of time
When it creeps up on you

No one's noticed our loneliness
Remember when you used to tease
And made us scream eternal joy

I believed that you'll always be here
'Cause once you promised a life with no fear
Please don't break my ideals
And say what's fake was always real

Hope was the one now I'm gone

Filming and screning
I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming
Dreaming of me

So we left
Understanding
Cleancut so we're sounding fast
Talked of sad
I talked of war
I laughed and climbed the rising cast

Quickly I remembered
Fused and saw a face before
Timing reason
Understanding
Like association hall

Paint yourself a picture, something perfectly obscure
To hide away the messes behind your manicure
And all of my obsessing to find the perfect words
Sick of second guessing, I didn't mean to make you hurt
Didn't mean to make you hurt, hurt hurt

What do you say when your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it?
What do you do when you just don't get it, you just don't get it?
Where do you go when you reach your limit, you reach your limit?
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one, that's all I know, you're all I know

Break another mirror to keep away the stares
Of another guilty reflex, a reflection left in tears
And all of my obsessing, tell me what was it worth?
Guess I should have learned my lesson, I didn't mean to make you hurt
Didn't mean to make you hurt, hurt, hurt

What do you say when your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it?
What do you do when you just don't get it, you just don't get it?
Where do you go when you reach your limit, you reach your limit?
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one, that's all I know, you're all I know

Wake me, early I've been dreaming
Dreaming that I'm only, only good enough for me and no one else
So wake me, early I've been dreaming
Dreaming that I'm only, only good enough for me and no one else

What do you say when your heart's not in it, your heart's not in it?
What do you do when you just don't get it, you just don't get it?
Where do you go when you reach your limit, you reach your limit?
'Cause all I know, all I know is
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one, that's all I know, it's all I know
You are my only one, you are my only one
You are my only one, that's all I know, you're all I know

Some of us turn off the lights and we live
In the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly

Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of 'em wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life

Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me

Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove

Well, I can't escape from the memory
Of the one I'll always adore
All those nights when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River shore

Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I've tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of the life of crime

And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song

Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River shore

Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about

Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I've had to pull back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River shore

Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life

Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody ever saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River shore

There is no love lost here between us
Where are those friends who pulled no punches
Shock from my hip with one another
We got so far from them
We're miles from way back when

I'm so nervous saying this out loud
As the words roll off my tongue and out my mouth

I can see a change, I can see a change in you
I see it coursing through your veins
And it is a shame, oh it is a shame on you
I barely recognize your face

And I don't like what I'm seeing lately
I don't like who I'm seeing lately

So many seasons fell beneath us
Too many voices on our shoulders
I miss us dancing through the same noise
But here we are my friend
We're miles from way back when

I never knew that I could be so down
I never knew that I could be so down until I told you

I can see a change, I can see a change in you
I see it coursing through your veins
And it is a shame, oh it is a shame on you
I barely recognize your face

And I don't like what I'm seeing lately
I don't like who I'm seeing lately

Maybe I'm living in the past
Who am I to judge
I'm the worst of all
Some things are better left unsaid
But I miss the person I knew before

I can see a change, I can see a change in you
I see it coursing through your veins
And it is a shame, oh it is a shame on you

And there's a ghost on the horizon

Oh! Oh! ...

Oh I'm scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

And there's a man on the horizon
Wish that I'd go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

Who creates these wonders like nobody can?

Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real

Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe

'Cause when it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do

When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true

When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true

Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throw over mind

Took me by the hand and pulled me to the stairs

Put her tongue all up in my ear, (Gross!)
Almost made me spill my beer, (Oh, shit!)
She's up and ready to go, but I don't care

Turn off my phone

Now I know how Ke$ha must be feelin'

Bros try to turn me upside down
And put a keg tap to my mouth

And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh!

And it's not a homeless life for me

You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while
Little 15

Little 15
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth
It's already more than enough
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And it's little intrigues
Do you understand
Do you know what she means
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she's seen
You will
Little 15

Little 15
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is 3 little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while

Oh, I thought he kinda liked me.But all this time he was
thinking of someone else - me! Oh, these questions!
He wasn't interested in me. He was interested in me!

so special about an English accent?
Cheerio! Oh, tallyho, doctor!
Yes, she gave me the jolly message. Oh...Nuth...
Nothing is wrong! After all, what is time?
If you miss me in this life you can catch me in the next.
Come on an' watch! 'Ay wot, well Kippered Herring! ...

I don't know why they redesigned me
He likes the way he used to find me
He likes the girl I left behind me
I mean he...I mean me...
What did I have that I don't have?
What did he like that I lost track of?
What did I do that I don't do the way I did before
What isn't there that once was there?
What have I got a great big lack of?
Something in me that
He could see that
Beckons to him no more
I' m just a victim of time
Obsolete in my prime
Out-of-date and outclassed, by my past!
What did he love that there's none of?
What did I lose the sweet warm knack of?
Wouldn't I be the late great me if I knew how?
Oh, what did I have I don't have now?
What did I have that I don't have?
What do I need big supply of?
What was the trick I did particularly well before?
What did he see that's gone in me?
What did I use that now I'm shy of?
Why is the sequel never the equal?
Why is there no encore?
Where can I go to repair?
All the wear and the tear
Till I'm once again the previous me!
What did he like that I am not like?
What was the charm that I've run dry of?
What would I give if my old know-how still knew how?
Oh what did I know?
Tell me where did it go!
What, oh, what did I have I don't have now?

2088,Barbra Streisand,1964,If A Girl Isn't Pretty,soundtrack: Funny Girl,"

[FUNNY GIRL is the life of vaudeville comedienne Fanny Brice (1891-1951),
starting in 1910. Actually the show starts after she has become a success
on stage and flashes back to her origins.  It opens in Fanny's dressing room.
She is waiting for her husband, Nick Arnstein, to return after being in prison.
She looks back to when she was a 19-year old hopeful. Her mother's poker
buddies think she's wasting her life trying to break into show business.]

[Mrs. Strakosh:]
Fanny, when people pay good money in the the-ay-ter--
especially the male element--they want something to look at!

If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City,
All she gets in life
Is pity and a pat.

[Mrs. Brice:]
Is a nose with deviation
Such a crime against the nation?
Should I throw her into jail
Or drown the cat?

[Mrs. Strakosh, O' Malley and Meeker:]
She must shine in ev'ry detail
Like a ring you're buying retail,
Be a standard size that
Fits a standard dress.

[Mrs. Strakosh:]
When a girl's incidentals
Are no bigger than two lentils

[Mrs. Strakosh, O' Malley and Meeker:]
Then to me that doesn't spell success.


Fanny auditions for Keeney's Music Hall but Keeney kicks
her out of the chorus because she doesn't look like the
others. Eddie Ryan, dance director for Keeney, agrees:

[Eddie:]
If a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City,
She should dump the stage
And try another route.
Any guy who pays a quarter
For a seat just feels he oughter
See a figger that his wife can't
Substitute.

Kid, my heart ain't made of marble
But your rhythm's really horr'ble
And that map of yours just ain't no
Valentine.
Everything you got's about right,
But the damn thing don't come out right
So forget it, kid,
And just resign.

[Chorus:]
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
If a girl isn't pretty,
She should get a job,
Go get a job--
Get any job
Get a weekly pay,
'Cause if a girl isn't pretty
Like a Miss Atlantic City,
She's a real Miss Nobody, U.S.A.

Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays forever more

[Eva:] Your act hasn't changed much
[Magaldi:] Neither has yours

[Peron:]
I stand here as a servant of the people
As we come together for a marvelous cause 
You've shown by your presence, your deeds and applause
What the people can do, true power is yours
Not the government's, unless it represents the people

[Che:]
One always picks the easy fight
One praises fools, one smothers light
One shifts from left to right
Politics, the art of the possible

Time and again I long for adventure
Something to make my heart beat the faster
What did I long for I never really knew
Finding your love I found my adventure
Touching your hand my heart beats the faster
All that I want in all of this world is...
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink
Of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I've known are what you are
Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine...
Dah-dah-dah...
Someday my happy arms will hold
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine...

Hey you, say that you're only having fun and then
You call me up at 3am again

To let you know that I am all alone

I can hear the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still

I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?

Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes
But me, I can't cover what I am
Wherever the children go I'll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I'm not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?

I've given up the game, I've got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can't be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange

One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it

And I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy,
But I know she wants me

I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry, yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me

All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

But I have already tried to explain myself

I'm scared to stand right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is baby oh
Deep down you know, yeah

Too often and too cold
But you aren't even listening
Because you are just

Too old to feel an earthquake
Or too cool to even care
But you aren't even listening
So why should I?

You are
A natural disaster
And I've wanted you too much
And now I'm gonna lose
I've wanted you too much
And now I've gotta choose

You're the cause of all this
And I'm sick of trying to please you
And you're gonna feel my emotions coming
Because you're the world

Like a broken dam you're empty
And all that's left are the sticks and stones
That were built by other people
And it really shows
But you aren't even listening
Because you are just

Too old to feel an earthquake
Or too cool to even care
But you aren't even listening
So why should I?

Flashing lights, shattered dreams
A paradise it seems

Those same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me.

How could I help it?
Tears were starting.
Good-bye to golden nights
Beside the silvery seas.

I long to hold you dear,
And kiss you just once more.
But you were on the ship,
And I was on the shore.

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart keeps praying
That someday harbor lights
Will bring you back to me.

Fellas that were in the mood
Don't just stand there, let's get to it
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it

Ooh, you've got to just
Let your body go with the flow

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.

Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
Whooo
How could I ask for more?
Lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just want to be served
And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Letting the water fall

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

- Tell me you love me
- I love you a million percent

I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

- Oi, I feel like you don't love me
- Why do you feel like that?
- Do you like me?
- You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

- Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
- Like how?
- Just, like, mummy, I'm, I'm, the feeling that I have. Like, um, I feel a bit confused
- Why?
- I don't know. And I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing
- Oh, at all?
- At all
- And that would make me go...

My little love
Tell me, do you, you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

- I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me. You're half me and you're half daddy
- Oh

I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, I feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
And I feel like today, I'm home and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that, but I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot

Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whack-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go wit'
I spot you at first glance and go shit!
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow!
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam

But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be Token if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

[Eminem, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts:]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me

Said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
Shorty, you the shit
Girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Eminem:]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides you're fire (I love) like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda, why I love

[Eminem, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts:]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me

But if we really care
So much is there

Why run away
When what we have is so worth fighting for
Why let it go, if ev'ry day
We can hide our feelings less
So we can love each other more
Why let it go?

There's no such thing as good goodbyes

Why let it go, if ev'ry day

Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,
Left my mama a goodbye note,
By sundown I'd left Kingston,
With my guitar under my coat,
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,
Got a room at the YMCA,
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,
Just lookin' for a place to play,
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,
I run outta money and luck,
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,
On a overloaded poultry truck,
I thumbed on down to Panama City,
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,
Makin' music on my guitar,
I got the same old story at them all night piers,
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles,
Roamed a thousand miles of track,
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,
At a club they call Big Jack's,
A little four-piece band was jammin',
So I took my guitar and I sat in,
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,
With a swingin' little guitar man.
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
Find yourself down around Mobile,
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,
If you got a little time to kill,
Just follow that crowd of people,
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.

[The TV-special verse:]
Well, I came a long way from the carwash,
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really ain't  got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm gonna get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I' m a swinging little Guitar man

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before

Get that feeling
Head is reeling
You think you're in control
But you don't know me babe
I can move you
I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way

I don't think you understand
What I'm trying to say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control

Watch your action
Close reaction
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head
Conversation, my creation
Nothing that you do
You do unless I said

You don't know the consequences
Of the things you say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control

All the things you tried to do babe
And all the words we said before
Are only part of what I started baby
And you can't stop me anymore

You see me sitting here, a smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things, together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find, the answer to our life

This world is not at ease, we seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me, to face our destiny
The jury's here so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
(We fall out of line)
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find, the answer to our life

So, tell me why we have to cry
And not try
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start a new

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight?
We'll find
The answer to our life
Show me the way, give me a sign

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

Ooh, baby

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed

Ce gar√ßon, moi je le plains
Ne croyez pas que demain
Une seule seconde
Je serai seule au monde
Laissez, laissez-moi cette nuit
Sortez mais sans moi
Allez boire √† mes amours
A tous mes futurs amours
Mes prochains je t'aime...je t'aime...
Laissez-moi et ne croyez pas surtout pas
Que je vais pleurer pour √ßa
Seulement mon coeur n'y comprend rien
Mis √† part √ßa rien, rien
Non c'est rien, aussi peu croyez le bien
Je n'ai pas tant de chagrin
Je n'ai pas tant de chagrin
Non c'est rien...non c'est rien
Rien!

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing...

... that ignorance and hates may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

So play the game Existence to the end...
... Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Si jamais je me perds
Si jamais je prends l'eau
Ouvre-moi la porti√®re
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si tu fais marche arri√®re
Si tu regrettes tous ces mots
Car au creux de l'hiver
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si tu veux bien encore
De mon c≈ìur et de mon corps jusqu'√† l'aurore
Me laisse plus comme √ßa toute la nuit au-dehors
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si jamais on s'endort
Dans notre petit confort
On changera de port
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si on roule vers le nord
On laissera notre d√©cor
Se consumer alors
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si jamais on s'en sort
Je te redirais une fois de plus alors
Que m√™me s'il n'est pas √† ce jour d√©j√† mort
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si tu veux bien encore
De mon c≈ìur et de mon corps jusqu'√† l'aurore
Me laisse plus m'en aller toute la nuit dehors
L'amour peut prendre froid

Si tu veux prendre l'air
Si tu veux changer de peau
Referme bien la porti√®re

Don't clean the place up for me no more

Make love no more
No late night movies with me no more
Play fighting jacuzzis with me no more
Don't shake your booty for me no more 
Look what you done to me 
Can't speak no more 
Yeah, girl 
I just wanna be a better man 
I'm far from an angel or reverend
The streets tryna make a brother sell again
But I just wanna hold hands with you again
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
No dirty dancing 'tween us no more 
And no romancing 'tween us no more 
There's no affection 'tween us no more 
There's no direction where do I go
They wanna see us let go but I'm sure you know 
That I will never walk out that door 
And I'm sure you know 
That I will be there to fight for you and will look out for you 
Even though you were letting go 
You will always be my only 
No I'll never leave you loney
You're my friend, you're my homie
I'm coming home-y

I just wanna be a better man 
I'm far from an angel or reverend
The streets tryna make a brother sell again
But I just wanna hold hands with you again 
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more 
Wanna let you know that I'm like your shadow
And no matter where you go my heart will follow
Even though you've seen a lot, heard a lot 
One thing's for sure is we're all we've got 
Hope to ease the pain by telling you just one thing 
That I'll always love you 
I just wanna be a better man
The streets tryna make a brother sell again
But I just wanna hold hands with you again
Why why would you think I don't love you no more
No more no more no more no more
Why why would you think I don't love you no more 
No more no more no more no more

Flyin' a million miles

And turn right back around, around

Nothing's wrong and I don't need any help

When you turn it back around, around

To pick up the phone
Just to hear the words behind the sound
I'll turn this back around, around

And realize mistakes are repairable
You can turn it back around, around

Could be?
Who Knows?
There's something due any day
I will know, right away
Soon as it shows
It may come connanballing down
Through the sky
Gleam in its eye, bright as rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
under a tree
I got a feeling there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me...
Could it be, yes it could
Something's comin', something good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click, with a shock
Phone'll jingle, door will knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when
But it's soon
Catch the moon
One handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver to me
Will it be, yes it will
Maybe just by holding still
It'll be there
Come on, something
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is humming
And something great is coming
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight...
Maybe tonight...
Maybe tonight...!

Back porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rules
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed
With his eye all red, with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school

Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like he's better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time 'most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee

Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Armchair quarterback's always moanin'
Second guessing people all day long
Pushing, fooling and hanging on in
Always messing where they don't belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isn't it a pity that in this big city
Not a one a'little bitty man'll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong

Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me, don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine

Deep in a corner of the night
We were lying in the middle of the road
Counting the planes as they flew by
Inconceivable imagining them go
And drunk we set the world to rights
As we fell and hit our heads upon the curb
You make me laugh until I die
Can you think of any better way to choke?

Stories told to me and stories told to you
And did you ever feel like they were ringing true?

And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
And way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

Not everything had gone to plan
But we made the best of what we had, you know
Passing the drink from hand to hand
We admit we really know nothing at all

Stories told to me and stories told to you
And was it feeling real, and were they ringing true?

And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
And way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

I'll take my chances on the curb here with you
We watched the planes leave us behind
On the curb here with you
We watched the planes leave us behind
And then you put your hand in mine
And pulled me back from things divine
Stop looking up for heaven, waiting to be buried

And all their words for glory
Well they always sounded empty
When we're looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven
And way down here upon the ground
When we're lying in the dirt
There's no looking up for heaven
Looking up for heaven

Never admit it but it hurts

Doesn't mean a thing 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day I won't care
But for the moment I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not Joan of Arc

She's the only one I'm thinking of
And I wish she understood the way that I feel about her (She's mad)
She said she's had enough (Oh)
Now I'm up in the club like
Ooh, up in the V-I, sitting on a chair
Ooh, that's when I saw her sitting over there
She was chilling with her girlfriends (Yeah)
I was chilling with my homies (Yeah)
Then she made her over to my table (Whoa)
And she started dancing all on me
I should've said, Hold up, (Hold up)
Don't you know my girl?
But the alcohol in me, make me wanna cut up
Damn, I'm out on the floor with her
Out the corner of my eyes
See my girl best friend I'm like
Damn, I know

She seen me

Oh, she seen me out with another girl (Girl girl girl)

Now I'm thinking, oh, what I'm gonna say to her when I get home (And I've been drinking)
Man, the way that her girlfriend was staring at me, I know she got it wrong
And I know she see me out on the floor (Yeah)
And it was only a dance nothing more (Yeah)
I'm thinking, maybe, I could be wrong
Wondering why she calling me on my phone
I should've said, Hold up, I got a girl.
But I didn't care

Didn't know she would be up in the club, no

Now that the club is over, I know I should go home
She keep calling me, but I know I don't wanna do wrong
If I go, we gonna be up all night
I rather that, than fuss and fight
We should make it worth the while
'Cause I'm in trouble now
So, I might as well stay out with this other girl

She seen me
She seen me
She seen me
Oh, she seen me out with another girl (Girl girl girl)
Oh, heard I was out with another girl (Girl girl girl)
Whoa, now, I'm caught up with another girl

(She seen me) And I wanna take it back but I can't

_x000D_
We kiss in a shadow
We hide from the moon
Our meetings are few
And over too soon.

I have dreamed
That your arms
Are lovely...
I have dreamed
What a joy you'll be...
I have dreamed
Every word you whisper

We speak in a whisper
When you're close
Close to me.

Afraid to be heard...
Alone in our secret
Together we sigh
For one smiling day
To be free...

How you look
In the glow of evening

To kiss in the sunlight

I have dreamed
And enjoyed the view

And say to the sky

In these dreams
I've loved you so
That by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you

Behold and believe

I will love
Being loved by you

Behold how my lover loves me...

He will not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say
Something wonderful
The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do
Something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams
That won't come true
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you.
You'll always go along
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him, when he's strong
He is Wonderful
He'll always need your love
And so he'll get your love-
A man who needs your love
Can be Wonderful!

Hey... Can you hear me?
I just wanted to let you know...
Hmm...

I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.

And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one...

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...

I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out? '
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us.
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing.
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.

And of the pieces of my soul...
(Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...)
You know I never wanna be alo-oh-oh-one...

I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...

It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...
It's just for now so I should hush...
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but,
I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...

There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was rapeing his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot.
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me.

I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face,
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?

I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air,
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you...?

5141,Eminem,,Syllables,,"

It's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
.Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don't give a shit about lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitz
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
Oh, this my jam, this my shit
We don't know a word to a verse,
All we know is the chorus
'Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new emphasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
Than I'm gonna feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
'Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her, We're in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu, Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong syllable

[Dr Dre]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting 'cause ever since then it's been innocence
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
It's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

[Eminem]
(Wait, Dre, look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be 'cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

[50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into shows, riding on lolo's
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo's
Don't fuck with the dodo's, that's slang for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked lock,
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beat behind me playing, so you ain't hear anyway
You don't hear what I'm saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I'll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere he turned
Shady aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much
And Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the Fuck offs
All y'all eat salt, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
New syllables eat ball, you fucks off's
Your house, your bitch I'm getting sucked off
East, south, midwest, even up north
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk

[Ca$hi$]
Shady made me for bringing it back
For the history of rap
It's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap
What happened to just spitting about living in the motherfucking city you at
In the grimiest condition, I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you could never be
It's a hitting, rhyme in the month deep
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby, I want you to hate me

[Eminem]
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I'll be true to you

[Talking]
It is not about lyrics anymore,
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot, hot, hot beat
And a catchy hook
A hot, hot, hot beat
And a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some god-damn records

Don't run away, come closer
I'll take you away from sadness
Let me lift you out of the darkness

The shadow of your smile stays on my mind
And every song I hear reminds me of you

Every breath, every step, I'm closer to you
Every day (every day), everything (everything) reminds me of you
I can't forget you at all

Don't be afraid, come to me
I know that you've been hurt and you're scared

Everything I do, I'm thinking of you

Every breath, every step, I'm closer to you
Every day (every day), everything (everything) reminds me of you
I can't forget you at all

Love means letting go of fear
And I have nothing but love for you, my dear

But rainbows are filling the skies
My heart must have painted those rainbows
Shining before my eyes
Can't you tell that I'm in love, darling?
Deep and true, with guess who, darling
Someone I'd die for
Beg steal or lie for
Eat humble pie for
Someone to fly
To the sun, moon and sky for
Someone to live for
To love with and cry for
And that someone is you...

Hear my voice where you are
Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me
Catch a plane, catch a breeze
On your hands, on your knees
Swim or fly, only please, come back to me
On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel wringing wet
I don't care, this is where you should be
From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the highway to dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me

Blast you hide, hear me call
Must I fight City Hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on Earth must I do
Scream and yell till I'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
And to wreck and to ruin
Mademoiselle, where in Hell can you be?

Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a Royce or a van, wrapped in mink or saran
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the din
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me

Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot
By the rail,
Come by mail, COD
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux

Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
Under drugs under glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a crate, with your head on a plate
I don't care this is where you should be

Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (Shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back...

Will you stop bothering me?

It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love,
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance of rain
But my baby's in town,
And we're gonna do some winter things

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

My baby's in town
And we're gonna do some winter things
Hey

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's a hundred degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice and no chills,
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town,
And we're gonna do some winter things
Hey

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

My baby's in town
And we're gonna do some winter things
Hey

Just imagine that we're laughing
In my cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

My baby's in town
And we're gonna do some winter things

When I was a little girl I wanted to be a soprano
But my mother said my dear you've got to practice you piano
No soprano's in to man but a piano's always grand
And grand pianos in a band make money darling
And so each afternoon when I come home from school
I practice like a bloody fool
You can't imagine all the awful things I play
I could never see a friend
I'd have to practice without end
And as the time was dripping by
I watched the clock without denial
I got the window on the sky
I wished so tearfully that I
Could come outside and play
Instead of wasting every day
Of learning something that
Without a doubt
I could have really done without
It was such a bore
And I could here the boy next door was having fun
And that was something that I'd really never done

When I was a little girl I wanted to be a soprano
But I had to sit and practice on my rotten old piano
Playing major scales and than I played the minors once again
Now up and down the keys I play and out of these
I play a tirade of all the exercises
Never any new surprises
Girl you keep your fingers wrong
What a sound
All I wanted was to sing
And not to make the raftest ring
With my old piano
Practicing I would have popped my back
I sing, I hated every minute of the keyboard I devote
That is why today I'm a soprano, but the sight of a piano
Makes me shot before I can not play a note

And saves me from myself in times of envy when I'm missing everyone

And only my heart knows my head is lying, lying

Take a breath to notice I'm between

Packed with illusions, our world is turned around

And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown

Now moving slowly, we circle through the square
Two passing planets in the sweet, sweet summer air
Sweet summer air

And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

Reflected mountains in the lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Would something have to break?
We have to stay awake

Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

Lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

Drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this

Living beyond your years
Acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
It's just begun

Standing on the cliff face
Highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death

Look out to the future
But it tells you nothing
So take another breath

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
And this is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

You put up your defenses when you leave
You leave because you're certain

You're putting up your armor when you leave

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait! Where you going?
I'm leaving you!
No you ain't. Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
Who's that dude?
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Wait, I think we're on to something
We can't run from fate
But we can let it take us down
Down this road, where all our colors run together
Let's take the worst and make it better
Let's take this mess and make a home

I know it gets hard for you to stay
But do you really wanna throw it all away?

I'm thinking that we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Tonight, take all the ghosts and all those skeletons you hide
Bury them deep beneath the ground
Let them rest, 'cause you weren't meant to bear that burden
Look at the roses in your garden
You can breathe now and forget

Forget it gets hard for you to stay
But do you really wanna throw it all away?

I'm thinking that we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

Just hold out for tomorrow
Our dreams will follow
Follow us back to when
When nothing was broken
The future was open
Let's go back again (let's go again)

That we could make forever after all
Finding the gold in our darkest moment
Watching the roads turning into white roses, roses
And we don't ever have to leave these walls
I'll be the boy with the silver lining
You'll be the girl with the cinderblock garden

The girl with the cinderblock garden

Puedes escuchar Fernando?
Me recuerda tiempo atras
Estrellas y una noche alla
En la lumbre azul Fernando
Tarareabas tu cancion
Con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podia escuchar
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

Se acercaban mas fernando
Y el momento que pasaba
Parecia eternidad
Y senti temor Fernando
Por la vida y juventud
Nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy verguenza al
Confesar que tuve
Ganas de llorar

Algo habia alrededor quiza
De claridad Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos
En proteccion Fernando
No pensabamos jamas perder
Ni echar atras
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer
Lo haria ya Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer
Lo haria ya Fernando

La vejez llego Fernando
Y con ella una paz
Que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmio el tambor Fernando
Paraciera que fue ayer
Que lo vivimos tu y yo
Y en tus ojos veo aun
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.

Algo habia alrededor quiza
De claridad Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos
En proteccion Fernando
No pensabamos jamas perder
Ni echar atras
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer
Lo haria ya Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer
Lo haria ya Fernando

Algo habia alrededor quiza
De claridad Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos
En proteccion Fernando
No pensabamos jamas perder
Ni echar atras
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer

Lo haria ya Fernando

You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you... lately
And every time I look at you
I can't explain how I feel insane, I can't get away
You're my daydream, yeah

You're making me insane
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know

I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade

I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave

We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade

We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy and they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)

We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you
In an octopus's garden with you

No matter what people say
I'm gonna keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gonna keep doing my thing

[Eminem]
I'm almost as famous as fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Musketeers to sing
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck [crash]
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Gotta have it, I hold Tylenol in his hands
'til it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?)
The fool who visit the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol whipped with a Mauseburg
With a pistol grip and fed pitbulls shit
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich, I just get sued

[Redman]
Yo, I leave with no injure, after I blow four in you
One handstand on top of your ninja
Crash it, (ERRRR) Doc stir the madness
'til you all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walking, cans in the laundry basket
America's most with the army after us
Fuck flossing, we take what's yours
A low fifteen like a ace in four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
(shit, the power's out)
The tape is off
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled with arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber miss
Betty you with a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake
Fuck bitches face is what I'm gonna do
'Cause that what white boy Tano do

[Eminem]
So how is everybody doing tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
'Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you all don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall!!

Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, got Marshall Maths [printing]
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I'm What's happening? with no Rerun
Doc Rob Deniro when the Heat come
My barrel hang out the Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogardin'
Your wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M & M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them

[Eminem]
It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stopped inside the lunch box [uh]
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good, thank God for Vodka
'Cause with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With an automatic calling me up there
My man Stan with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a tan tinted Sedan
He pull your mouth out 'til you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam
'til you gotta sip through a straw, shoplifted a mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma, maybe I'll give you a call
Sike you fucking bitch, suck a dick and two balls
I'm giving you all my job descript'
which is to piss bitches and priest off with this
Pop more pills than police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But you all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
'Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well as be a painting smashed on the floor

[Redman]
So how is everybody feeling tonight?

Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling

This is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am

It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breaking

And I've been wrong, I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, Are we having fun yet?
Are we having fun yet?

It's not like you didn't know that
I said I loved you and I swear I still do
It must have been so bad
'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you

This is how you remind me
This is how you remind me

Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little cafe just around the bend
I am calling you

I am calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know a change is coming
Coming closer, a sweet release
I am calling you
(I know you hear me?)
I am calling you
I'm gonna walk through the desert to find you
Gone leave behind the only life I know
There's a place for hearts that need fixing
A little cafe with a magic show

Deck the halls with boughs of holly

And be thankful for all that we have
All the lights and decorations
Put up in anticipation
Of the joyful celebration

We're counting the days
'Til it's time for Christmas day

Oh and God bless us everyone
The good and the bad
The happy; the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone
Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again

On the streets there's children laughing
People smile as they are passing
Christmas time is here, our waiting is done
Wishing it could last forever
Not just twelve days in December
Through the year let's try to remember
That special way
That everyone feels
It's the magic of Christmas day

Oh and God bless us everyone
The good and the bad
The happy; the sad
Oh and God bless us everyone
Here's to family and friends
It's good to be here again

So fill your heart with love and joy
And through the eyes of girls and boys
Share their wonder, live through their joy
It's easy to do, just open your heart
The spirit will come to you

Oh and God bless us everyone

My words are cold, I don't want them to hurt you

My knuckles all bruised up from knocking on heaven's door
My body still aching from sleeping on cement floors
I was taught to be non-violent when I'm at war
But it's so hard to move in silence when the lions roar

Cuz I was born in shackles (you protected my soul, you left me)
All alone in shackles (oh, went through it all, you blessed me)
You lift me up when I was down, no hope, no vision
Lift me up when all of y'all were against me, were against me
Now you'd come back to scarlet, the dark days
They'd all illuminate, yeah
We miss you, Mandella, we miss you, Mandella

Suffering no more, oh yes, a fight and I fight and I fight until I can't no more,
You see these whips and these chains around my neck just might be my flaw,
But these whips on my back represent what I endured

Cuz I was born in shackles (you protected my soul, you left me)
All alone in shackles (oh, went through it all, you blessed me)
You lift me up when I was down, no hope, no vision
Lift me up when all of y'all were against me, were against me
Now you'd come back to scarlet, the dark days
They'd all illuminate, yeah

Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
You gave me my freedom
Freedom, freedom, freedom
And I will never surrender, I won't surrender
No surrender, no no
And I will never surrender, I won't surrender
No surrender, no no

Find a piece of mind I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again
And I belong again
For when you look at me
I'm everything and more that I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise
I won't be alone
We'll love and live more
Love and live forever
With one more look at you
I'd learn to change the stars
And change our fortunes too
I'd have the constellations paint your portrait too

You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down

You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down

So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So you say, Go. It isn't working.
And I say, No. It isn't perfect.
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back

And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get

Knockin' so loud
Can you hear me yet
Try to stay awake but you can't forget

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So you say, Go. It isn't working.
And I say, No. It isn't perfect.
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed, ooh

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding was been,
Lives in a dream.
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door,
Who is it for ?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?
Father McKenzie, writing the words to a sermon that no one will near,
No one comes near.
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care ?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong ?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby died in church and was buried along with her name;
Nobody came.
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave;
No one was saved.
All the lonely people, where do they all come from ?

Let it go
Gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, your time, your time

Let it go
You gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, your time, your time

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are there armor
And you would destroy anyone that would try to harm 'em
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of the pain

'Daddy look what I made'
'Dad's gotta go catch a plane'
'Daddy, where's mommy
I can't find mommy where is she.?'
'I don't know go play Hailie baby your daddy's busy'
Daddy's writing a song
This song ain't gon' write itself

I'll give you one underdog
And you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song
And tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother
Who's a spittin' image of her
That's slim shady
Yeah baby slim shady's crazy
Shady made me but tonight
Shady's rock-a-by-baby

Let it go

Your time, your time, your time

Let it go
You gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, your time, your time

I'm too attached
My heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you can call that
When I see you in the streets
That's the worse for me
Used to love the little things you did
That's what works for me
It's too major
Don't see you on my pager
Know what you doing, where you at or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me 'just let her go bow'
Believe me, I'm trying man, I just don't know how
I be in all the top spots
Leaving with all the hot shots
Knowing they just want me 'cause I'm in the 'top spot'
That's not poppin' and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking, who she with, or where she going
Is she club hopping?
I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is the first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night and every flight
And every time you in my sight
Damn this ain't even right cause

Let it go
Gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, you time, your time

Let it go
You gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, your time, your time

I keep having this dream
I'm pushing Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming
She don't want me to sing
'Your making mommy cry, why, why is mommy crying'
'Baby daddy ain't leaving no more'
'Daddy your lying, you always say that
You always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, daddy your mine'
She's piling boxes in front of the door
Trying to block it
'Daddy please daddy don't leave daddy no stop it'
Goes into her pocket
Pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture
'This will keep you safe daddy take it with you'
I look up
It's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking 'cause man I can hear 'em
Their saying you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em
Before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, there gone
And the spotlight is on

Let it go
Gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, your time, your time

Let it go
You gotta let it go
Keep living your life 'cause it's your time
Your time, your time, your time

She filled the folks in Munchkin Land
With terror and with dread
Till one fine day from Kansas
A house fell on her head
And the coroner pronounced her: DEAD
And through the town the joyous news went running
The joyous news that the wicked old witch
Was finally done in
Ding-Dong! The witch is dead!

Wake up! The wicked old witch is dead!

Uh, I've got my mask on
Uh, I'm numb to the world

[Hook - Mr. Porter:]
The devil out to get me, moving pretty fast
Head on collision, I'm tryna avoid the crash - (Pain)
I'm running from my past - (Bane)
That's why I wear the mask
These blood sucking leeches, all they want is the cash
You don't get the picture, it could be gone in a flash - (Pain)
I'm running from my past - (Bane)
That's why I wear the mask

[Verse 1 - Mr. Porter:]
Hope you bought a package of Kleenex (yeah)
Package the rejects (yeah)
Actually it‚Äôs a fact that we shack in the p-jects
Naturally a rat pack will attack cheese (huh)
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in yellow and green
May I tap, trap all these (uh)
No I don‚Äôt trust these hoes, nigga (uh)
Say they love you for you then turn into gold digger (Bane)
What the fuck you ask me for a dollar for?
Shooting the gym? I ain‚Äôt ballin' ho
What I look like, any baller you know? (Bane)
Yup, shots fired, callin' it kettle
Black shit turned the pot higher
Eyes tired
Keep trying to sell me a smile, but I‚Äôm a hard buyer
Keep shit movin' like a car tire
What you want a necklace
I‚Äôll make you a chain out some barbed wire

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Swifty McVay:]
I got his Earth on my shoulders, real life for rappin'
If you threw the planet at me I‚Äôd headbutt it and crack it
On another tax bracket and I been cleanin' my house
But my old habits are in the attic, I‚Äôll pull 'em out
And keep reminding y'all you ain‚Äôt got it all
Devil keep pulling me by the drawers
Not at all amazed at these haters
You‚Äôve seen my catalog
Speaking and we keep flying over 'em like a cannonball
Think I‚Äôm this comical, swag follower
Just rhyming over beats
While these leakers suckin' all of us off (hell no)
Still got your mama covered in vomit in my cellphone
Y'all really got me fucked up
What you mixin' up in that cup?
What the hell you sprinkle in that blunt?
.44, make him sober up

[Verse 3 - Bizarre:]
I got an addiction to all these prescriptions
Need an intervention, someone to listen
Catholic or Christian, fuck your suspicions
(Bitch! Gimme my molly and stop bitchin'!)
Turn it up (turn it down)
I be blowing on half a pound
Pass it around and pass it around
Merry go-round, merry go-round
She say she love me, but this bitch is ugly
(Shit, you ain't even know it)
I'mma still let her fuck me

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Kuniva:]
They say the devil is a liar
Nigga don't worry 'bout that loud mouth
Bumping his gums and babbling
Watch for them quiet niggas
On the real, you should come ride with us
Crew full of riders; Optimus
My back, seems like you got your facts all crossed up, no Swastikas
Fadin' in and out of my consciousness
Tryna fight this feeling I‚Äôm conjurin'
That's why I wear a hat so low with a mask
Really feelin' like the Lochness
No bullshit, these bitches are more grimy
Doing a nigga real slimey
Had my little homie stretched out, death untimely
Need I remind me? Hold up
Yo, don‚Äôt get doped up
Heard rumors that niggas wanna clap at me
Well actually, I was just over there
Niggas ain‚Äôt really do jack to me
That‚Äôs why I keep this mask on, straight face
Only thing that‚Äôs missing is my [?] get my Runyon Ave soldiers

I'm sittin' on my terrace, lost in the stars
Listening to the sounds of the sad guitars
Been thinking it all over and I've thought it all through
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

I saw the first fall of snow
I saw the flowers come and go
I don't think that anyone ever else ever knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

I'm giving myself to you, I am
From Salt Lake City to Birmingham
From East L.A. to San Antone
I don't think I can bear to live my life alone

My eye is like a shooting star
It looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near or far
No one ever told me, it's just something I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

If I had the wings of a snow white dove
I'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
A love so real, a love so true
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

Take me out traveling, you're a traveling man
Show me something I don't understand
I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her

I traveled a long road of despair
I met no other traveler there
Lot of people gone, lot of people I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
Just takes me a while to realize things
I'll see you at sunrise, I'll see you at dawn
I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone

I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
I hope that the gods go easy with me
I knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too
I've made up my mind to give myself to you

Here is a song
From the wrong side of town
Where I'm bound
To the ground
By the loneliest sound
That pounds from within
And is pinning me down

Here is a page
From the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong here

The heat and the sickliest
Sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees
And my feet
But I'm drowning in time
To a desperate beat

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong

Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath

God send the only true friend
I call mine
Pretend that I'll make amends
The next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line

And I thank you
For bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found
That I belong here

But I was born without a doggone thing

Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
'Cause I've had my share 

I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but

Why does he still behave as a child

leftovers from childish behavior

And I don't like it

Oh my, my, my, my

But I just hope we didn't waste it away

But why, just 'cause we're a little older 
Do I relive it, I relive it all?
Oh, I'm pedaling backwards
Even if I'm pedaling alone
Can't help it
I relive it, I relive it all

It's 4AM here comes the fear
I'm not prepared yet
And when we pick over the past we glorify it

Stacks in the grass tryna police mix

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

And you'll ride upon, a big white swan

You and the swan will float upon

And the moon is a marshmallow dream

The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'm gonna do all that I can
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me when everyone was telling
You don't sign me, everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm crying in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke

Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was riding to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fucking back-stabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Making wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they'll scream, Dre, don't leave us like that man! 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home (home, home)
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down the walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home (home, home)
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark

[Verse 1:]
We may not understand this whole process and how things go
I'm just an ordinary man tryna live free and God knows
See a man with a blue tie
See a man with a red tie
So how about we tie ourselves together and get it done
Do what's right for America
And all we ask from you is some honesty
And motivation give us something we believe
I'm only one man with a voice to something we got in common
Need a model well then look at me

[Chorus:]
He's a democrat
He's republican
There's a fight and a race who's gonna win
Put your differences aside man if you can
Cause there's way too many people suffering
I wish they didn't have no labels
There'd be more change with no labels

[Verse 2:]
My kids will grow up soon
Your kids will grow up too
Wouldn't you like to see them raised up next to good hospitals and good schools
Don't want 'em in a juvenile facility
Or growing up with mental disabilities
When all this time you could've made a difference but you decided to roll with the party
Are you kidding me
Cause all we ask from you is some honesty
And motivation give us something we believe
I'm only one man with a voice to something we got in common
Need a model well then look at me

[President Abraham Lincoln:]
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America.

[President John F. Kennedy:]

Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand,
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace

Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers

Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place

You're such a motivator, gotta get your way
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike

Got me so high, and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like

Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She make me want her right now right now

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million
My lucky strike

Got me so high, and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like

Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

Got me so high, and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me

Oh oh oh my lucky strike
Oh oh oh my lucky strike

Well my manager rang
He said, I hate to break the news
But the label called today
They said they have to cut you loose
I felt broken like a vase that'd fallen from the roof
Tears rolling down my face
Lord, what am I to do?

I felt pain in my life so far
A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar
One that might not heal

So I said
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
And I don't know how I'll survive
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
I'll admit it's a struggle
Finding light in the tunnel
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day
Of my life

Well I gave up my degree and I moved away from home
I was following my dream, now there's nowhere I can go
So I called up my mom and I was bawling on the phone
I was acting like a child but I was all the way grown

I felt pain in my life so far
A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar
One that might not heal

So I said
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
And I don't know how I'll survive
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
I'll admit it's a struggle
Finding light in the tunnel
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day
Of my life

So I thought to myself that now is time to choose
I can pick myself up or I can give in to the blues
So I swore in my heart that I was never gonna lose
I would crawl until I made it
'Cause I got something to prove

I felt pain in my life so far
A fractured wrist and a broken heart
But this is sure to leave a nasty scar
One that might not heal

So I said
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
And I don't know how I'll survive
It's the worst, it's the worst day of my life
I'll admit it's a struggle
Finding light in the tunnel
This is the worst day of my life
It's the worst, it's the worst day
Of my life

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?
It's me and Kelly!
My bad (Sorry)
Let's try another room
I don't trust you
Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods
Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab
Oh dag (Mmm)
I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag
Huh?

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl

And now it's my fault, my fault

Yo, Sue
Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's trippin'
I need to go puke (Blehh)
I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)
She said, Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure
I said, I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me
She said, I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful
Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you
He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude
Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?
Well, it depends on how many you had
I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol
She's gonna die, dude
I know and it's my fault
Oh my God

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Susan, please wake up, please
Please wake up, what are you doing?!
You're not dead, you're not dead
I know you're not dead
Wake up, Susan, wake up

Staring from a cardboard castle
Down and out
One of life's young students
Finds out what it's all about
Paper flutters
Angry taxy drivers shout

From the pages of a paper
Candles shine
On a perfect table
Laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop
Wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that
No one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Sometimes
When eyes meet you know
They have to meet again
Sometimes
Birds of a feather
Got to fly together

From a dingy attic window
Candles shine
On a perfect table
Laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the
Highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine

I'm so glad
My fine young friend
Glad for you

I'm so glad
My fine young friend
Glad for you

You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue
Why so blue

You didn't know
Little secret
It ain't what you got, baby
It's what you do with it
And you doing it
You doing it

My guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire
Caught in a love affair with feminine iconic style
So fine, you got good taste
But I hate to see your pretty body going to waste
Prefer to see you in the bare necessities
Like Coco de Mer or La Perla, baby
Getting me aroused in that intimate attire
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like
Vicky got a secret, everybody knows
Lady in the street, in bed hoes and me
Wearing Cosabella
With nothing but a trench coat, nothing's better

Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
(You know what I'm talking about)

'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

Girl, you're a goddess, when you slip that Eres on
Don't stop, your sexy silhouette on the wall turns me on
Good God, your bod
And our bod keep deep
Don't mope when I say nice, but nasty
I wanna tell your man, I do what I say

What you gonna do? You gonna put it on?
Girl, you so sexy, you ain't gotta take it off

Throw them heels back on, come one

Exaucerons nos pri√®res

Et c'est pour √ßa que je vous dis merci

Et j'ai chant√© pour vous
Je suis tomb√©, me suis relev√© devant vous

Should anybody ask where I've been
I'm swimmin' in a sea of her
I thought I might be drowning and then
I washed up on a beach with her

In the palm trees shade
Where my head was laid
I thought I'd hold he when I hit the sun
But I'm still outta reach again

I put this message in a bottle and I send it out to sea
Ocean bring my baby back to me, back to me
This is a message in bottle that I hope she gets to read
Ocean bring my baby back to me, oh oh oh oh oh
This is a message in bottle that I hope she gets to read
Ocean bring my baby back to me, back to me

I'm thirstin' for the warmth of your skin
Am hungry for the feel of you
I'm waiting to be with you again
So I could sleep and breath with you

In the palm trees shade
Where my head was laid
I thought I'd hold he when I hit the sun
But I'm still outta reach again

I put this message in a bottle and I send it out to sea
Ocean bring my baby back to me, back to me
This is a message in bottle that I hope she gets to read
Ocean bring my baby back to me, oh oh oh oh oh
This is a message in bottle that I hope she gets to read
Ocean bring my baby back to me, back to me

Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine

Go dance in the woods
And down we go, down, down
Oh, boy, you‚Äôre mine
Do you remember old times?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You‚Äôre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it‚Äôs so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You‚Äôre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

Sweet love of mine
Destruction ain't a crime
For those who find
Love is a game like you and I

Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried
Oh, boy, we're fine
Do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You‚Äôre a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it‚Äôs so hollow without you

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die

Gone for someone else to share

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes

I'll hold your body in my hands
Be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

Oh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin

Fingernails the size
Of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump
In four months you'll open your eyes

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe

'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be alright

'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, √íThat's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry√ì
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going

Pushing through unknown jungles every day

How I used to be and how you dealt with me (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
Just want to thank you

Just in case I never see your face again
Just in case the worst was meant to happen
Just in case tomorrow never come, there is something you should know (should know)
I've given you every bit of the man I am (the man I am)
I know at times, it wasn't pretty, but it was all I had
I never held back, not one little bit, and the world can attest to this
And baby, you flipped my program upside down (upside down)

I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times, I hated myself for
The way I went about it, the ups and the downs
One foot in, while the other foot's out
Loving on you, loving on another
But I ain't no different from any other brother
So what I give to you right here, right now
In this here place (is my voice, say it out)
In this here space (let my heart pour out)
As I state my case, as I break it down
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done
So you've feel the change you've made, stay with me every day

I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)

But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

Girl, if I died tonight before I wake
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
And sugar, if this song is I had to give, would you remember?
Remember my heart, remember it was good
Remember that I tried as long as I could
Remember that I gave 'til I had nothing else
Remember my voice

I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember

I can't understand_x000D_
She let go of my hand_x000D_
An' left me here facing the wall_x000D_
I'd sure like to know_x000D_
Why she did go_x000D_
But I can't get close to her at all_x000D_
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime_x000D_
She said she would never forget_x000D_
But now mornin's clear_x000D_
It's like ain't here_x000D_
She acts like we never have met.
_x000D_
It's all new to me_x000D_
Like some mystery _x000D_
It could even be like a myth_x000D_
But it's hard to think on_x000D_
That she's the same one_x000D_
That last night I was with_x000D_
From darkness, dreams're deserted_x000D_
Am I still dreamin' yet ?_x000D_
I wish she'd unlock _x000D_
Her voice once and talk_x000D_
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
_x000D_
If she ain't feelin' well_x000D_
Then why don't she tell_x000D_
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face_x000D_
Without any doubt_x000D_
She seems too far out_x000D_
For me to return to her chase_x000D_
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played_x000D_
Her mouth was watery and wet_x000D_
But now something has changed_x000D_
For she ain't the same_x000D_
She just acts like we never have met.
_x000D_
If I didn't have to guess_x000D_
I'd gladly confess_x000D_
To anything I might've tried_x000D_
If I was with her too long_x000D_
Or have done something wrong_x000D_
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide_x000D_
Though the night ran swirling and whirling_x000D_
I remember her whispering yet_x000D_
But evidently she don't_x000D_
And evidently she won't_x000D_
She did act like we never have met.
_x000D_
I'll leavin' today_x000D_
I'll be on my way_x000D_
Of this I can't say very much_x000D_
But if you want me to_x000D_
I can be just like you_x000D_
And pretend that we never have touched_x000D_
And if anybody asks me, Is it easy to forget ?_x000D_
I'll say, It's easily done_x000D_
You just pick anyone_x000D_
And pretend that you never have met.

Cause this goes out to the anti's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
The yugo's in tha (ghetto) ghetto ooh we livin in tha...

[Verse 1: Akon]
These streets remind me of quicksand (quicksand)
When your on it you'll keep goin down (goin down)
And there's noone to hold on too
And there's noone to pull you out
You keep on fallin (falling)
And noone can here you callin
So you end up self destructing
On the corner with the tuli on the waist line just got outta the bing doin state time
Teeth marks on my back from the canine
Dark Memories of when there was no sunshine
Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
(I remember like yesterday)
Holdin on to what God gave me...

[Chorus: Akon]
This goes out to my tata's in tha (ghetto)

The yugo's in tha (ghetto) ghetto ooh we livin in tha...

[Verse 2: Ali B - dutch]
Je kijkt om je heen maar kan niet geloven wat je ziet
Een gebied vol verdriet hele wijk is falliet
Een bandiet die weer schiet in de ronte voor niets het is een
Plek waar je vermoord word voor een simpele fiets
Ik heb het over de ghetto's van de verenigde staten
Waar kinderen van twaalf rond lopen met een wapen
Maar ook in nederland is het niet altijd wat het lijkt criminaliteit
Stijgt in de achterstandswijk kijk ik wil niet zeggen
Dat de bijlmer als new york is maar heel veel van die mensen
Doen of het een dorp is waar nooit iets gebeurd terwijl
De flats zijn bezet door de junks aan de crack je houd jezelf
Voor de gek...

[Chorus: Akon]
This goes out to my tata's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
My mocro's in tha (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
Cause this goes out to the anti's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
The yugo's in tha (ghetto) ghetto ooh we livin in tha...

[Verse 2: Yes-R - dutch]
Jongens stap het liefst je verdriet is diep van binnen
Je wilt wel opnieuw beginnen maar je word geconfronteerd
En je ziet van die dingen je broertje gearesteerd
Je vader zakt zachtjes neer je moeder kan niet meer
Het doet je zeer
Je dropt die tranen kijkt uit het raam het is alsof je wijk is getroffen door een orkaan overal liggen vuilnis zakken
Er lopen ratten junkies die elkaar om een bolletje willen klappen
Politie rijdt voorbij en ziet iedereen als verdachte
In een keiharde wereld is er geen ruimte voor een zwarte
Survivor of the fittest is hoeveel heb je in petto heet is de
Eeuwen oude vraag als je leeft in de ghetto...

[Chorus: Akon]
This goes out to my tata's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
My mocro's in tha (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
Cause this goes out to the anti's in tha (ghetto)

Pass me a drink
You say it‚Äôs gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

You‚Äôre wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don‚Äôt reach
Your smile

You‚Äôre holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You‚Äôre eating your fears
In a cigarette

You‚Äôve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

I‚Äôve taken the blow
It‚Äôs all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no ‚Äòsee you later‚Äô

You‚Äôre wasting your time

You'll never know
What heaven means
Until you've been down to New Orleans
You ain't been livin' till you cuddle and coo
With some black-eyed baby by de old bayou

You've never seen
You've never seen those Cupid doll queens
Like they got 'em in New Orleans
And, ooh, they love you like no-one can
It makes you awful glad that you were born a man.

If-if-if you ain't been there
Then you ain't been nowhere
The livin's lazy and the lovin's fine
If you feel low down
So help me Hannah
You should lose the blues in Loui-si-i-si-ana.

And hot foot it down, hot foot down to where?

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Might get a little bit reckless with my heart
It's too much these days
She says she really wants to love me, but then again she might kill me
'Cause that's who we are

It's hard to understand
This relationship is a burning garden, break my heart like kindergarten
I'll hate you, then I'll beg your pardon
I love you now let's plant a garden

Give me fire, my girl, she's a liar

She was with him, I know that she was with him
And when I think about it I can't sleep

Now it's Judgement Day, and I'm a little bit angry
Might get a little bit reckless with her heart
It's too much these days
Oh I really want to leave her
But then again I still need her
It tears me apart

Who has the strength
To bear the pain
To forgive all the things that I've done

Oh girl
Lead me into your darkness
When this world is trying it's hardest
To leave me unimpressed
Just one caress
From you and I'm blessed

When you think you've tried every road
Every avenue
Take one more look
At what you found old
And in it you'll find something new

I'm shying from the light
I always loved the night
And now you offer me eternal darkness

Can make a better man

That's left us back where we began

Makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight

Reminding me
Of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight

Oh God it's raining
And I'm not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
I'd been mistaken for dead
But not tonight
"
7133,Paul McCartney,2008,Highway,Electric Arguments,"
_x000D_
Running through the nighttime
And looking like a wreck
Got too many highlights and a love bite on her neck
Looking for some pay daddies who'll maybe come around
Everybody's wondering
What's that sound

Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)

Standing in the doorway of a little black shop
Lifting up a pin light and ringing up a cop
Running down the street
Everybody sees
What she's got is what she needs
And what she loves is me

Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)

Oh looking in the flowers
Hang on me every hour
Take me high and let me think
Move me baby, move me away

Everybody wondering why you're looking such a wreck
Yeah

Highway
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)
Always
(Do ya, do ya, do ya)

Everybody wondering why she didn't love me more
They damn know what it self

Somebody can move me
Oh I'm feeling naked
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again

Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again
Words are getting higher
Everybody fire
Lord the sun is rising again

_x000D_
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the Doc replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the dope, so when names come up
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere, where it fires and I unload my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause those were new
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you fronting?
You know I got you open, kid

Rest in peace to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like I'm in a zone
I'm in a whole different league on my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appetit
Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed, up in the Ebony Show-
-case with Denaun screaming Who the fuck passed you the mic?
Never asked you to like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get the motherfuckin' skills cracking
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so motherfuck Loud
They jerked me around so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbing it in and holding some grudge now, but don't front

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you fronting?
You know I got you open, kid

Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago, I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fucking mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
Don't front

You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
You know I got you open, Word Life

Spend your money, win it on the number 9
Take your sweetheart even though she's never been
If she's worried tell her that you always win
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, you're gonna win a fortune tonight

Hear the whistle, lady luck's about to go
Is she smiling, maybe yes or maybe no
Now's the time when nights are filled with sweet romance

We coulda cleared up all these particulars
That coulda been the homicide, vehicular
You wasn't in no state to speed off
You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin' up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed when you got the phone call
That's the effect they call a snowball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' Please come back, I have given my all
I have given my all
Funny how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all
Catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

You wanted oh-so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
That maybe I shoulda never taken you from her
But with all of the aforementioned
I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waiting
'Cause I am in need of more attention
Coulda called back just to say sum'
I'ma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doin' well, exclamation
You succeeded at your attempts to make me
Need you desperately to vindicate me

And you're memories seem like just so many souvenirs
I will come to you to ease the pain

If you want me tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend

Of the way it was 'til it went away

Breaking news: Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour to check himself into rehab after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops.
Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated--
On and off again relationship with...
This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus...
Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot
Shady/Aftermath recording artist...
Long-time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12
D12, back in the news again today...
Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem
He insists he's just taking a break, but doubters believe he's retiring, leaving us all to ask, 'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'

So this is it...
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Famed to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me (in) to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping-pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from a opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

Take that moon,
Wrap it in cellophane;
Down with love let's liquidate
All it's friends,
Like moon, June, roses
And rainbow's ends,
Down with songs
That moan about night and day;
Down with love,
Take it away, away,
Take it away, take it away,
Give it back to the birds,
And the bees and the Viennese,
Down with eyes romantic and stupid,
Down with sighs, down with cupid.

Down with love!
Liquidate all it's friends

And rainbow's ends

And I don't stand a chance with a ghost like you
Ah, the promised kiss of Spring is here...
Why does my heart go dancin' overhead...
On the ceiling near my bed...
We go now...
Because I talk to the trees, but they don't listen to me...
I tell them:
You say eether - I say eyether,
You say neether, I say nyther
Eether, eyether
Neether,  nyther
Let's call the whole thing off!
Take it away, take it away
Give it back to the birds
And the bees and the Viennese...
Down with eyes romantic and stupid
Down with sighs, down with cupid,
Brother let's stuff that dove,
Down, down, down
I go on round and round
I go in a spin,
Hey, in the spin, I'm in!
What is this thing...
What is this thing called love?

Just incase a nigga wanna to take my brain
Then the voice came down from the sky and said

I had to re-evaluate my thoughts and think about what  got me this far 
I had to keep a strong faith and believe in one day i would be a star (a star)
But i knew that it wouldnt come easy (come easy)

Never thought success would come this quick in the beginning (but i seen it)
And all along im sittin there thinkin its harder when you came from the hood (you came from the hood)
But all i had to do was put my mind to it and realize it was all good (it was all good)
Once i got rid of what held me down best believe i wouldnt be turnin back (turnin back)

Wanna take it from the top?

Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: I gotta meet her like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it‚Äî

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (Word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pep√© Le Pew shit!
Ain't steppin' to you, bitch, I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
Letter come to me‚Äîmail. Sweater, heat, some degree. Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said‚Äî

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it‚Äî

All day, all night
You feel, my heat (Fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (Duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl
Your body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too‚Äîlook at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it‚Äî

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!

I've had it up to here, up to my neck
With everything politically correct
Just wanna lock myself away, leave me alone
Gonna lay it all out on my hairbrush microphone

I wanna sing like nobody's listening

I wanna party like a believer

Too much information in my head
I need to disconnect, I'm in the red
Just wanna get my body right back in the zone
Gonna lay it all out on my hairbrush microphone

I wanna sing like nobody's listening

I wanna party like a believer
I wanna wear whatever I wear

Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend_x000D_
Be it mine right or wrongfully_x000D_
I let it slip gladly to my friends_x000D_
To tie up the time most forcefully_x000D_
But the bottles are done_x000D_
We've killed each one_x000D_
And the table's full and overflowed_x000D_
And the corner sign_x000D_
Says it's closing time_x000D_
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
_x000D_
Oh ev'ry girl that ever I've touched_x000D_
I did not do it harmfully_x000D_
And ev'ry girl that even I've hurt_x000D_
I did not do it knowin'ly_x000D_
But to remain as friends we need the time_x000D_
And make demands and stay behind_x000D_
And since my feet are now fast_x000D_
And point away from the past_x000D_
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
_x000D_
Oh ev'ry foe that ever I faced_x000D_
The cause was there before we came_x000D_
And ev'ry cause that ever I fought_x000D_
I fought it full without regret or shame_x000D_
But the dark does die_x000D_
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes_x000D_
Must meet the dawn_x000D_
And if I see the day_x000D_
I'd only have to stay_x000D_
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
_x000D_
Oh ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind_x000D_
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung_x000D_
But it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes_x000D_
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung_x000D_
But the time ain't tall_x000D_
Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed_x000D_
By no special friend_x000D_
And though the line is cut_x000D_
It ain't quite the end_x000D_
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
_x000D_
Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time_x000D_
To disgrace, distract, and bother me_x000D_
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face_x000D_
And the dust of rumors covers me_x000D_
But if the arrow is straight_x000D_
And the point is slick_x000D_
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick_x000D_
So I'll make my stand_x000D_
And remain as I am_x000D_
And bid farewell and not give a damn.

Yo
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight
Yo

I'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you, non-stop
I walk up on ya, Well, hello Tonya
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
C'mon

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell, like Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do

Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know

Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

[Chorus:]

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

[chorus]

It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you

Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow

When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window, and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road

But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more

I'm a-thinking and a-wonderin' walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long honey, baby
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well

I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face

What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing

I'm falling fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say, Let's take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too.

I'm falling fast

It doesn't matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters

What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
I already know

I'm falling fast

'Cause I'm falling hard for you

Take it while we can
'Cause I know you feel it too.

I'm falling fast

I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard

We can go, no holding back

For you

We can go, no holding back

Let me zip off my boots, we can go for a walk
If I rein you in, you can follow my lead
We can ride so fast, just remember to breathe
If you start to gear up, then I'll tighten my grip
If you try to talk back, I'll be using my whip
Not be hard to hear you with my whip in your mouth
If it starts to hurt then you'll have to scream loud

There's no use going back 'cause the damage is done
Go away, all the rules 'cause it's gonna be now
Come on and let yourself go, 'cause there's no time to think

If you want, I'll feed you like an animal
If you want, I'll hunt you like an animal

If you misbehave, I can make you submit
If you start to act up, I can force you to quit
If you want me to break you, I can bring you the heel

I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger

Sorry you put your trust in others and they let you down
And all the the secrets and unknown evidence now in the open that you found
Cried yourself to sleep so many nights, said you'd never again
I'm not the one you hold it against, baby, it's not my blame

Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn

'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking 'til you let me in

What I gotta do (anything I gotta do)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do (tell me)

You're stuck inside, no matter how hard you try to forget
Don't you wish there was a button we can reset and make it easy
But you can't take back the decision that you made to love
I know it's one that you regret and not too proud of
Because you keep telling me

Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing

Baby, tell me
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do (what I gotta, baby, tell me)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do

I remember the break-up
And the condition that my heart was in
But I would never surrender, no, no
I gotta be stronger, there's nothing time can't heal
Girl, I know your scarred
All I ask is a chance to come in and do my part
It's nothing but fear and you been holding on since
Too under pressure and I see you sinking in

Say, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking 'til you let me in

If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Or are you unforgiven, too?

Behind this time
I'm cleaning out my mind
There is no space
For the regrets
I will remember to forget

I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies
At which I vibrate
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I'm leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows
That it cast
There is a radar in my heart
I should have trusted
From the start

Just look at me
I'm a living act of holiness
Giving all the positivity
That I possess
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It's meant to be
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me

Fat man lookin‚Äô in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin‚Äô at his last meal
Hollow man lookin‚Äô in a cotton field
For dignity

Wise man lookin‚Äô in a blade of grass
Young man lookin‚Äô in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin‚Äô through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year‚Äôs Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin‚Äô high, searchin‚Äô low
Searchin‚Äô everywhere I know
Askin‚Äô the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin‚Äô out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin‚Äô to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want nobody see me talkin‚Äô to you‚Äù
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would‚Äôve gone deeper, but there wasn‚Äôt any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn‚Äôt any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin‚Äô man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Lookin‚Äô into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he‚Äôd give me information if his name wasn‚Äôt used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin‚Äô ‚Äôcross the silver sand
Steps goin‚Äô down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the bordertowns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I‚Äôm on the rollin‚Äô river in a jerkin‚Äô boat
Tryin‚Äô to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin‚Äô for the doctor‚Äôs cure
Lookin‚Äô at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin‚Äô his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I‚Äôm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it‚Äôs gonna take
To find dignity

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Good
Who never learned to read or write at all
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell

Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go

And you will be the leader of a big band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday you will be in lights saying Johnny B. Good

We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care

You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head

A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool

Baby we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories

Those thoughts of past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe
You'd never wrong me
Then will you remember
Me in the same way
As I remember you

Baby we built this house

Take my picture now
Shake it till you see it

Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Ooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Ooh I thought I'd die in your arms

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Hope you know, I won't let go

Summer me, winter me
And with your kisses morning me, evening me
And as the world sleeps far away, star away
Forever me with love
Wonder me, wander me
Then by a fire pleasure me, peaceful me
And in the silence quietly, whisper me
Forever me with love, forever me with love
And every day I'll gentle you, tender you
And oh, the way I'll velvet you, clover you
I'll wrap you up and ribbon you, rainbow you
And shower you with shine
Suddenly, magically
We found each other there we are, here we are
I plan to let you happy me, summer me, winter me
Always be mine
'Cause suddenly, magically
We found each other there we are, here we are

I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
I love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me

Ever since you walked right in the circle's been complete
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul

You gave me babies, one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood

It's never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.

Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone

And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets: I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zapping rappers, singers and dancers
Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathing
Surviving by conniving and thieving

I had a dream I was getting jacked by biters
It felt like I was being attacked by spiders
Developing a fear: a biterphobia
I'm holding a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya I'ma pulverize
Dissect your brain, diggin' in your skull for lies
Then I'ma torture
With material iller than a stark raving mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist, so beware of the aura
A terror for the horror will scare ya tomorrow
This is an airborne assault of other rappers
Either start developing skills
Or head for the border and run like hell up in hills
The choice is yours
Besides all these noises force me to scream 'til my voice is hoarse
'Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws
And crabs that grab at yours
And saboteurs that bite like Labradors
You're in range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble and peril

I trample and stamp liars like they were campfires
'Cause vampires bite on my balls, and clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringing my nig' Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
'Cause biters are falling head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewing my fingernails, pulling my hair annoyed
'Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with an ultimatum
I assault and slay them with rhymes and insults
And made 'em difficult to fade 'em
Energetic and imaginative
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab you 9 times out of 10
That's why I'm spilling one-of-a-kind rhymes out a pen

We may find a trace
Of a state of grace
In the saddest face
Something is there

How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surrounds us
Help us to always care

Then the seeds we sow
Will survive and grow
And we all will know
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surrounds us
Help us to always care

In this world where ever present dangers
Circle round our family heart
Like a throng of hostile strangers eager for a war to start
There appears a friend's familiar face
Oh sweet relief, the heart goes to a warmer place

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

And this we prize
For this we hold so dear
This state of grace

We may find a trace
Of this state of grace

Something is there
This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the goog that surrounds us
Help us to always care

Life aboard this fast revolver still remains a magic mystery
Loud reports of anger fill the pages of our history
Those of us with love can now embrace
With sweet relief a life lived at a gentler pace

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

And this we prize
For this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

In the night a daffodil
Is battered by the father of all storms
Daybreak sees it stand alone
Amongst a field of lifeless forms
Rays of light illuminate
Where sweet relief presents a shining yellow face

And this we prize
And this we hold so dear
This humble state of grace

We may find a trace
Of a state of grace
In the saddest face
Something is there

How the rivers flow
We may never know
But it goes to show
Something is there

This guiding light
Will burn so bright
So much wonder around us
All the love in the air
Let the good that surrounds us
Help us to always care

The the seeds we sow

2927,Bob Dylan,2006,Thunder On The Mountain,Modern Times,"
_x000D_
Thunder on the mountain, and there's fires on the moon 
A ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, where I'm gonna grab my trombone and blow 
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go 

I was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying 
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line 
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be 
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee

Feel like my soul is beginning to expand 
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand 
You brought me here, now you're trying to turn me away 
The writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it does say 

Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum 
Going to sleep over there, that's where the music is coming from 
I don't need any guide, I already know the way 
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day 

The pistols are popping and the power is down 
I'd like to try something but I'm so far from town 
The sun keeps shining and the North Wind keeps picking up speed 
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need 

I've been sitting down studying the art of love 
I think it will fit me like a glove 
I want some real good woman to do just what I say 
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 

Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground 
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down 
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my King 
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 

Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches 
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages 
I been to St. Herman's church, said my religious vows 
As I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 

I've got the pork chops, she's got the pie 
She ain't no angel and neither am I 
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes 
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams 

Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be 
Mean old twister bearing down on me 
All the ladies in Washington scrambling to get out of town 
Looks like something bad is going to happen, better roll your airplane down 

Everybody going and I want to go too 
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new 
I did all I could, I did it right there and then 
I've already confessed, no need to confess again 

Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up North 
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth 
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf 
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself.

Go! Go! Go!

Gotta get a leadway

Got fire in my pocket
I just lit a rocket

I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain

You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh

I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else

I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss

Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth

I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl

You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me

But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg

You are my goliath
You are my goliath
And I am mistress dread

Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread

Open and release me
I love you in my head

Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away

All I ask my baby
Kiss away

All I ask my baby
Kiss away

Here speaks the voice of reason

And obviously
It's something to say

Here comes another sentence
It is relentless
It tries my patience
But nevertheless
It's for our concern

We can't see the benefits
So we'll ignore it
Or disobey it
And then we'll say that
This is fun

This is real fun

Just because I rang her number by mistake today

And just because I haunt the same old places
With a memory I will linger everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
Lord, you know, she thinks I still care

Well, if she's happy thinking I still need her
Yeh, let that silly notion bring her cheer
Oh how could she ever be so foolish
Tell me where did she get, lord such an idea

Yeh, oh lord

Anyway that's all yesterday

Why worry if it's right?

_x000D_
Maybe I should have saved
Those left-over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day!

Here's that rainy day
They told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way!

Where is that worn-out wish
That I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?

Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here!

[Instrumental break]

Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny...
That rainy day is here!

Fall off in the spot
Wait up, they gon' do it while you drop

Pull up with no top
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
And you know my necklace, sittin' on ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl comin' like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fin pick you apart
Glowin' in the dark, fifty some' girls on board
Runnin' with the marksmen, everything on point like, En garde!

Yo, I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin'

They keep tellin' me work it, I ain't got no chores
I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby, I'ma floss
What? Why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like wings, Barbie sittin', bada-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arm in a sling
Hopped off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Don King
Who the fuck gon' party with them dollies? No, I never do the mollies
If I hit you, then you probably gon' sue
Who the fuck gon' come through with the body, always lookin' like a hottie
Always sayin' what somebody won't do?
Who the fuck gon' pull up in your city, lookin' every bit of pretty
With the itty bitty titty bitch crew?
Who the fuck gon' beat him with the .22 if he don't lose the attitude
And run off with his credit cards, too?

I see everyone looking at me
Don't ask me why, never have to try, so

Let me introduce you
To the coolest guy I know
You'll go (hello hello)
I'm unstoppable (hello hello)
So damn lovable
Even if you think you'll find someone
He'll never be just like me
Hello, hello, I am Mr. A

They would think that you're insane
Not to wanna know my name
After looking in my eyes
You will never be the same, no
What exactly do you think
You'll find on the other side?
So go ahead and try
'Cause I am that guy, so

Let me introduce you

Dark in the city night is a wire
Steam in the subway earth is afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood Drumming on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
A scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is alive all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
My mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

There's only so much you can learn in one place

I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight 'til I find a place of my own

Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hand

My circuits have blown
I know it's self-imposed
And all I have shared, and all I have loved
Is all I'll ever own

But something has changed
I feel so alive
My life just blew up, I'd give it all up
I'll depressurize

Oh, oh, oh, ten thousand miles left on the road
Oh, oh, oh, five-hundred hours 'til I am home

I need something human, human
Human, human

Let's face all our fears
And come out of the shade
Let's burn all the money, absolve all the lies
And wake up unscathed

The big picture's gone
Replaced with visions of you
Now life can begin, I've cleansed all my sins
I'm about to break through

Oh, oh, oh, five thousand miles left on the road
Oh, oh, oh, two-hundred hours 'tll I am home

I need something human, human
Human, human

And I need the touch
And something human, human

I need something human, human

And they feed on insecurities I have

Soak the ropes with your holy water
Tie me down as you read out the words

Set me free from my jealousy

Exorcise my mind

When I'm haunted by your ancient history
Close these green eyes and watch over as I sleep
Through my darkest of dreams

Be the power to compel me
Hold me closer than anyone before

If we should ever do this right,

Oh I'll never let you down,
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down.

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,

Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,

My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again,
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend,
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again,

And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see dreamily, Emily too
Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see dreamily,
They see Emily
As my eyes visualize a family
They see dreamily, Emily too.

Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup,
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lots changed since I seen you last.
She said...

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, Everyday I wake up, hoping to die
She said, They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more that shit
You can't even relate to

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet!

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do if your son was at home

50 Cent
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (Ha-ha)
Here we go again
Yeah
The evil genius, Green Lantern

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say, What up?, keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin' reckless, but if you go check my belt
You may see something else I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I'll hurt your pride, dawg, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after
Syllable I just slap you, killin' you faster
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs
Of that shit you on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern!)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to
So what's the deal, where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja, what up, dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'm a grown man, dawg, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on!

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)
You talk and soon you gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me

You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six thru your hats, a seven and 3/8's
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I'll put my knife in your wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal, bitch

I know you don't want it with me

Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out your van and (Break it, break it, break it down!)
They see me pop a boy icy 'cause I could
You been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood (Hood)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us if half of your artists got make-up on?
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' 'bout what pain is, sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, motherfucker

I know you don't want it with me (You know you don't want it with me)

I had myself a true love
A true love who was something to see
I had myself a true love
At least that's what I kept on telling me
The first thing in the morning
I still try to think of a way to be with him
Some part of the evening
And that's the way I live through the day

I had myself a true love, but now he's gone
And left me for good
The Lord knows I've done heard those back yard
Whispers going 'round the neighborhood
There maybe a lot of things I miss
A lot of things I don't know
But I do know this, now I ain't got no love
And once upon a time I had a true love
In the evening, in the doorway
While I stand there and wait for his coming
With the house swept and the clothes hung,
In a pot on the stove there's a hot meal
Where is he while I waste the rising newel?
Where is he? Why'd he gone so soon?
Now there ain't no way that it used to be, what now?
And everybody keeps telling me
There are may be a lot of things I miss
A lot of things I don't know
But I do know this now...
I ain't got no love
And once upon a time I had a true love.

Standing on the water, casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with truth so far off, what good will it do.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care ? Ain't nobody there would want marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain 
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.

While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

We were bare knuckle tight lip
Turn the music up ego trip
Devil-may-care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times

With the boys in black chasing silhouettes
Of the girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed, when we cried
Those were the days we owned the nights
Locked away, lost in time
I found the nerve to say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
(Won't forget the good times)
I won't forget the good times
(Won't forget the good times)

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
(I won't forget the good times)

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through the sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summerflowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her head

When I awake and see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms,
The ache is there so deep inside me

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her fingers so softly
And then my Mary wake to love and love again

And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share,
We share together

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

I bought a girl Patron, I get in the Henn', I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin' me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone 'cause the DJ playin' my song
Just another opportunity for sayin' I'm known
I'm from Atlanta so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin' everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin' to gain but migraines and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo

Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get'cha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party ‚Äì turn the music up!
Let's get it started ‚Äì go 'head and shake your butt!
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck

One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious, full breast, ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin' head while he poppin' the clutch?
True that, I had a few, Obie rollin' with brews
And Nathaniel annually knockin' the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit, then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Shady ‚Äì you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum when the night came to the matinee

I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay

I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in running
This is something I gotta face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all

Of the love that he'd just found
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry

Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
She'd be mine eternally

That's me right there on the corner, listening to Wu in my Walkman
Neon lights hit the water, reflecting the city I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from's the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable cause wherever I go

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never, separate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I still believe that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead
These streets are my backbone, until I get back home

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not in the city, but out in the burbs
A river that's dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying in church
A crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
A promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own, I'm finally home
Hemma I Stockholm
D√§r jag h√∂r hemma

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm

He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint, in my mouth
Then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood
Ha ha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain't no good!

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone

I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland

We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland
Take my hand
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland
Take my hand
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland
We're off to Never‚Äî, Neverland

Stay here don't put out the glow

Hold me now, don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become
Oh yeah

Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So, help me, I can't win this war, oh no

Got nothing to hide no more

But to show you the shape of my heart

I never wanna play the same old part
Or keep you in the dark

You've been hanging your conscience on the fence
Cause you can't hold it
An empty promise laid to rest
A life is stolen
And there will be no consequence
For what you've broken
Don't you know, what your father said?

We are the only
We are the brave
We are America, but
We are to blame

Stand up! Stand up!
Can you hear me now?
All I! All I!
Really want now is
Your voice! Your voice!
Screaming out loud, saying
We can make it, or we can make it
Fist up! Fist up!
Don't put your hands down!
All I! All I!
Really want now is
Your voice! Your voice!
Screaming out loud, saying
We can make it, or we can make it

We've been biting our tongues for far too long
And they know it
They told us that hope would carry on
They really had us going
And there will be no consequence
For your sinful hypnosis
Don't you know, what your father said?

We are the only
We are the brave

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Beyonce:]
Well I found a man, stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
[Beyonce & Ed Sheeran:]
While listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
And he looks perfect
No I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

Turn the lights on

How could someone hurt you
But still make you feel so good?
Holler, scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it
Just 'cause he gives you pain, that don't mean he ain't the one
Fuck you out your brain, you'll be smiling when he's done

So, my advice would be no, don't leave
Don't go so easy
Let that argument turn you on
It's worth it

And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)

So hard to imagine
Living life without them there
'Cause now you're so caught up in the passion
But this shit is beyond compare
'Cause don't it make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drum?
You fall hard, but think about how hard you come

So, my advice would be no, don't leave
Don't go so easy
Let that argument turn you on
It's worth it

And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
Come here, look at me

No one wants to be fighting
All day long, all night long
So we'll just scream 'til we start making love
And as time goes on, we're feeling
Okay, babe, alright, love
And we'll forget about it in the morning

And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There's no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you're in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)

Psst... hey, listen! _x000D_
Lalalalala! I love my job. Whoo! Makes me feel like Superman!_x000D_
Can you fly? I can. Wanna see? 

[Chorus] _x000D_
I'm only entertaining you _x000D_
My goal is to stimulate, making you high _x000D_
And take you and I _x000D_
To a place you can't see _x000D_
But I believe you can fly _x000D_
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying _x000D_
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian _x000D_
Just a man who's on the mic _x000D_
So let me entertain you... 

[Eminem] _x000D_
My lyrical content is constantly under fire _x000D_
No wonder why I constantly bomb back _x000D_
To combat attacks with constant concepts _x000D_
When lyrics are constantly took outta context _x000D_
Failure to communicate with congress has _x000D_
Been a problem for the longest, I guess _x000D_
But maybe one day we can make some progress _x000D_
Food for thought - see how long it takes to digest _x000D_
Feeling good when I should be ashamed _x000D_
Sh*t, I really should've fell but I stood _x000D_
See I came like a flame in the night _x000D_
Like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray, there's a light _x000D_
There's a hope, there's a spark _x000D_
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye _x000D_
Until they decide to set their differences aside _x000D_
And this is why only one of us will survive _x000D_
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe, cause 

[Chorus] 

[Eminem] _x000D_
My music can be slightly amusing _x000D_
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing _x000D_
Just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment _x000D_
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it _x000D_
See I could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond _x000D_
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond _x000D_
Cause I came here to uplift; let your woes be gone, _x000D_
Tell 'em to get fu*ked and just mosie on _x000D_
Constantly moving, constantly using the constitution _x000D_
As a form of restitution _x000D_
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant _x000D_
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams _x000D_
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuilding, _x000D_
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim _x000D_
How many kids'll copy? Probably millions, _x000D_
But I'ma do this as a fu*king hobby till then, cause 

[Chorus] 

[Eminem] _x000D_
My lyrical content contains subject matter _x000D_
That sucks up all these fu*ked up young kids _x000D_
At an alarming rate; common denominate _x000D_
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate _x000D_
I try to stimulate but kids emulate, _x000D_
And mimmick every move you make - Slim, you great! _x000D_
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain? _x000D_
I gotta be the one to go against the grain _x000D_
Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane _x000D_
For me to see you be influenced but pretend you ain't _x000D_
But they don't understand that I've been through pain _x000D_
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain _x000D_
But you can't just stand there and try to judge _x000D_
It hurts but you're jealousy probably tears you up inside as much _x000D_
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch _x000D_
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but 

[Chorus]

And out in the ghetto
And brother there, but for the grace of god

Of a little angel
Don't you know, I'd fly to the top of a mountain
And then I'd cry, cry, cry
