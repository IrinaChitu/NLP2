How could I be this at ease with him?
Pour out my heart as I please with him?
He isn't you...He isn't you...
When will I feel so in bloom again?
When will his voice warm the room again?
He isn't you...He isn't you...
Memories may fade in the shadows behind me
But there'll be the dream
That will always remind me - a dream that
I'll be forever comparing him to...
For love me, he may even die for me
Sweep every cloud from the sky for me
He may be king,
But he'll never be you...

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you

Ain't nothing I can do

Oh oh oh

Yeah yeah yeah

Oh, in your darkest time
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

936,Ariana Grande,,Emotions,,"

Mhmm... 

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never been so... Satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
but I like the way you feel
Inside... 

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing in my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

It feels like a dream 
When you love me tenderly 
I don't know if you're for real
but I like the way you feel 
Inside 

You've got me feeling emotions 
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
You've got me feeling emotions 
Higher than the heavens above 

You've got me feeling emotions 
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
Oh baby, 
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above 

You know the way
To make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so... Highhhh

Alright

Ohhh, you've got me feeling emotions 
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of 
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above 

Ohh you've got me feeling emotions
Ohh you've got me feeling emotions
You..
You..
You've got me feeling higher

6124,Muse,,Host,,"

I’ve read you well
I just want to get away
Cos you used my love
I just need to get away

My trust in you has been abused
My trust in you has been overused

Sick of this space
Wish we could be far away
Cos I wasted all my youth
I’ll never see it again

My trust in you has been abused
My trust in you has been overused

Why can you get everything?
Can you tell me why I just want to run away?
Can you tell me why I just want to get away?

I just want to get away...

I just wanted too much
I wish we could be far away
And if my wish comes true
You’ll never see me again

4412,Elvis Presley,,I Shall Be Released,,"

They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shouting so loud
Crying out that he was framed

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Scrounging for change, to put some money in your pocket

Laughing at the suckers as you pissed it away

Don't fuck with the bad side of me
Stay away from the bad side of me

Running through the visions at the speed of light

Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss

He's your uncle, not your dad
He's the best friend you ever had
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts
Just remember Pearl Harbor

The Alamos and nothing could be worse

He's your favorite relative
And he needs a lot to live
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed
And he'll send back what he don't need

If you're not in form, ten-forty's your salvation
By deprivation of temptation
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?

When he calls you as he may do
Don't be frightened, red white and blue
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad
He's your uncle, not your dad

If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver
The food is lousy up the river
It's give and take and he does all the taking
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?

Life has two things you can't subtract
Death and taxes to be exact
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare

If dogs run free, then why not we 
Across the swooping plain ?
My ears hear a symphony 
Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come 
That's what they explain to me
Just do your thing, you'll be king 
If dogs run free.

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time ?
My mind weaves a symphony 
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee 
So it may flow and be
To each his own, it's all unknown 
If dogs run free.

If dogs run free, then what must be 
Must be and that is all
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall 
In harmony with the cosmic sea 
True love needs no company
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
If dogs run free.

4624,Eminem,2011.0,The Apple,"EP: ""Straight From The Vault""","

I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

Haha! Haha, haha, haha!
Alright look
I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!

Ohh darling
Ohh darling
Ohh darling

It's 4 a.m. beneath the stars, under the night
And you're here, and you're here
Candles lit, the room is dark, the moon is light
We can lay here, we can love here

Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling
Ohh darling

I brought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine
And a blanket, we used them all
I dreamt a day away on a planet full of life
To stay there, fell in love there

Perfect comes near, perfect just for one
Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling, ohh love
Ohh darling, ohh love

Lying down, her cheek is resting on my shoulder
I play with her hair, I adore her
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known, yea
We could stay here, run away, dear

Love knows no fear, but it doubted some
Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling, ohh love
Ohh darling, ohh love

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone

I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light

Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

A lifetime is starting to feel like
It's falling short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's coming around, around, around, around, around

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light that lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now

Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in

One broken heart for sale

Well, excuse me if you see me crying like a baby
Since she rejected me
There's nothing left to save me

Who wants to buy a heart

One broken heart for sale

She would not listen to the things my heart was saying
She turned and walked away
And told me I was playing

Some guys have all the luck
And my heart hasn't any

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

In their styes with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole

Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look, fresh and ready to cook

I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day
Of the most dangerous month of the year
At the worst time, at the worst place
That's all I seem to hear
I got up early
So I can greet the goddess of the dawn
I've painted my wagon, abandoned all hope
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, the Rubicon is a red river
Goin' gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon

What are these dark days I see?
In this world so badly bent
I cannot redeem the time
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last?
How long can it go on?
I embrace my love
Put down my hair
And I crossed the Rubicon

I can feel the bones beneath my skin
And they're tremblin' with rage
I'll make your wife a widow
You'll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch, I paid my debts
And I crossed the Rubicon

Put my hide up on a hill
Where some happiness I'll find
If I survive, then let me love
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road, take the low
Take any one you're on
I poured a cup, I passed it along
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
In all her womanhood
Others can be tolerant
Others can be good
I'll cut you up with a crooked knife
Lord, and I'll miss you when you're gone
I stood between heaven and earth
And I crossed the Rubicon

You won't find any happiness here
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter, try your luck
Find you some nice pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need
And who can I count upon
I strapped my belt, I buttoned my coat
And I crossed the Rubicon

I feel the holy spirit inside
See the light that freedom gives
I believe it's in the reach of
Every man who lives
Keep as far away as possible
It's darkest 'fore the dawn (Oh Lord)
I turned the key, I broke it off
And I crossed the Rubicon

Mona, baby, are you still in my mind?
I truly believe that you are
Couldn't be anybody else but you
Who's come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch, I looked to the east
And I crossed the Rubicon

Shadows, they like my wall

But lately, I lost my faith
What is love without pain?
It ain't home

You're watching me, but I'm below
When I get caught, I hope
It's the kind of blackout that will
Take me home

So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside, now I know

Never said I was an angel

If there ever was a time, then let it be now
Let me go through, open the door
My soul is distressed, my mind is at war
Don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
I'll take a sword and hack off your arm

Laughter turned to sorrow

You'll be looking at the future

You're everything, I ever knew

The only one for me is you

You're dangerous, but they won't stop
Until I leave, they won't believe
That being with you won't break my heart
So worried about the road ahead
They can't see that your my best friend
There never going to take me from you
There's nothing they can do

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself: how did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone... lone lone why lone

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

[Siedah Garrett:]
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming 
And he said, ""Well, well, well""
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
""How are you"" he said to me
I said it back to him.

I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there 
And she began to shout
""Go on back to see the gypsy 
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear 
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas 
And he can do it here"".

Outside the lights were shining 
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance 
With the music in my ears.

I went back to see the gypsy 
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsy's door was open wide 
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl 
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising 
From that little Minnesota town.

Always thought that we could be the greatest story ever to-o-old
But there's a rock inside my sock, I'll keep on walking 'cause it's co-o-old
And I can't stop the clock from ticking

Turning into smoke between our fingers

Rewind like an old cassette

Playing for you, you, you
I'll be playing for you, you, you

About the time we spent together will the memories disappear
It might sound crazy but my baby that's the thing that I most fear
Oh, I can't stop the world from spinning

Just leave me with a picture, just a picture of your face

Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it
I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage
I wanna drive this car right over the edge
Of every bad idea I didn't have yet

I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic
Dazed and confused, hard to see where we lost the magic
I never meant to be hypocritical
This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical

And just like that
I know there's no turning back
We already made this bed
And I can't even sleep in it

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
Till I hit an all time low

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad
Once in a lifetime
(Once in a lifetime)

I try to run, try to hide just forget about it
I tell myself every night I could live without it
I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness
But every time I do, I make another mess

And just like that
I know there's no looking back
We already made this bed
And I can't even sleep in it

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
Till I hit an all time low

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

And just like that
I know there's no turning back
We already made this bed
And I can't even sleep in it

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
Till I hit an all time low

Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad)
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

You're so happy now
Burning a candle at both ends
Your self-loving soothes
And softens the blows you've invented

Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

Crack's healing up
Future soul forgive this mess
You wait twenty years
And wind up alone, demented

Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

Breathe in deep, and cleanse away our sins

I was forgotten
Until you called my name
Lost in the shadows
Until you shined your light my way
Now I believe again
In all my dreams again
I'm wide eyed and innocent
Those doubting days
Are so far away and oh

I will fall
And you will catch me always
Time has taught me this
I will fly
And you'll be there to guide me
Straight up to my heart's highest wish
I feel you close to me
And I know what love is

Now there's no mountain
Too high for me to climb
No ocean so wide
That I could not reach the other side
Now I believe in me
Cause you live and breather in me
And nothing can come between
We are one star
No nigh can darken, Oh

I will fall
And you will catch me always
Time has taught me this
I will fly
And you'll be there to guide me
Straight up to my heart's highest wish
I feel you close to me
And I know what love is

It's an unspoken thing
A quiet opening
There are no words that can go that deep
But I know
I know

I will fall
And you will catch me always
Time has taught me this
I will fly
And you'll be there to guide me
Straight up to my heart's highest wish

Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
You're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been so in love?

Have you ever walked on air?
Ever felt like you were dreaming?
When you never thought it could,
But it really feels that good.
Have you ever been so in love?

Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
You're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been in love?
Have you?

The time I spent
Waiting for something
That was heaven-sent.
When you find it, don't let go.
I know.

Have you ever said a prayer
And found that it was answered?
All my hope has been restored,
And I ain't looking anymore.
Have you ever been so in love?
Have you?

Some place that you ain't leaving,
Somewhere you're gonna stay,
When you finally found the meaning.
Have you ever felt this way?

The time I spent
Waiting for something
That was heaven-sent.
When you find it, don't let go.
I know.

'Cause have you ever been in love?
So in love.
You can touch the moonlight.
You can even reach the stars.
Doesn't matter near or far.
Have you ever been so in love?

I said:
'Cause have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
So in love.

Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'

If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longing to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know...

Pasted, plastered – puke, drink up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoe strings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna

We 'bout have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you!)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God!
Come on
I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
Comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy – and his boy, and his girl
Ha-ha, Nate Dogg!

There's a spark of magic in your eyes
And Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairytales came true
But they come true, when I'm near you
Your a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise

And, betcha by golly wow!
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words
To express all he feels inside
But ever just so often
The words of another, who's truly in love
Seem to work our just fine

To say I love you
To say
I love you

Keep growing strong

4654,Eminem,2014.0,Guts Over Fear,"compilation: ""Shady XV""","

[Eminem:]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Eminem:]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ""Hi, My Name Is"" dropped

Started thinkin' my name was Fault
'Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog

Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught

""Do I really belong in this game?"" I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off

You keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they're gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah

Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to

[Sia:]
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)

An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Eminem:]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Eminem:]
I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on

But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit harder
Shit-learned how to harness it while the reins were off

And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art

And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?

And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun

So to the break of dawn
Here I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make ""Not Afraid 2""
Than make another motherfucking ""We Made You"", uh

And I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt

'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just havin' to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania
So when they empty that stadium
'Least I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done

So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off

The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was a

[Sia:]
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)

An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

See me sitting in the palmtree
Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no-one can harm me
They just stare at me and wonder why
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind

See me sitting in the palmtree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind

Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please

See me sitting in the palmtree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No-one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine

2987,Bob Dylan,,Huck's Tune,,"

Well I wandered alone through a desert of stone
And I dreamt of my future wife
My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command
In this version of death called life
My plate and my cup are right straight up
I took a rose from the hand of a child
When I kiss your lips, the honey drips
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Every day we meet on any old street
And you're in your girlish prime
The short and the tall are coming to the ball
I go there all the time
Behind every tree, there's something to see
The river is wider than a mile
I tried you twice, you can't be nice
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Here come the nurse with money in her purse
Here come the ladies and men
You push it all in and you've no chance to win
You play 'em on down to the end
I'm laying in the sand getting a sunshine tan
Moving along riding in style
From my toes to my head, you knock me dead
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

I count the years and I shed no tears
I'm blinded to what might have been
Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice
Play me the wild song of the wind
I found hopeless love in the room above
When the sun and the weather were mild
You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

All the merry little elves can go hang themselves
My faith is as cold as can be
I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof
If you don't believe me, come see
You think I'm blue, I think so too
In my words, you'll find no guile
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mister Bright Side, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

This always happens
Thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin, only option I have's McDonald's' bathroom
In a public stall droppin' a football so every time someone walks in the John I get Maddened
""Shady, what up?"" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that on second thought I'd be glad then
""Thanks dog. Name's Todd, a big fan"" I
Wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad threw it back and
Told 'im, ""Todd, you're the shit."" When's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub harassin'
I'd count my blessings but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask, suffering succotash, but the ant-
Acid it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what hoe kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper, Tupperware in the cupboard plastic ware up the ass
Stuck in the past iPod what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And ""life's been good to me so far""

They call me classless I heard that
I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned forty and still sag
Teenagers act more fuckin' mature Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I'll leave on my own terms ass
Hole I'm going berserk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people look at her, dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged and I heard she drag-races [burp] swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) word skag
We'd be the perfect match, 'cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies
No disrespect to technology
But what the heck's all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica
Hell with PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with Welch's
And belch, they say this spray butter's bad for my health,
But I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare, mentality helps to
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth
I managed to dwell
Within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, God damn it to hell
I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell the
Other day someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catching up with me

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And ""life's been good to me so far""

Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked

I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova the show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats told me to sign his poster then insults me
""Wow up close didn't know you had crow's feet!""
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shopping at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose (aaghh!) look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin'
Couldn't do nothin' play it off ""What you bumpin'?""
""Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better"", fuckin' bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with a
Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip, hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision
To fuck with, bitch, quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city,
But you pushed me to the limit. What a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky, and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But, bitch, I got an elevator in my house, ants and a mouse
I'm livin' the dream

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit

Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease on life
Add a little spice

Set me free
Remotivate me

Give me a reason
To scream and shout
Give me something

When everything is looking dull

Set me free

Because I'm willing to wait
But something must happen
Before it gets too late
It could be my imagination
But wasn't there more than this numb sensation

Set me free
Remotivate me

Set me free

2180,Barbra Streisand,1971.0,Since I Fell For You,"""Barbra Joan Streisand""","

When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so
And yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart
You may leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess it'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me
You love me then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm still
I'm still
I'm still in love with you
I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you...

I'm an emotional wreck, weak, everything over affects me
When you joke it upsets me, you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks
You hope I choke on a Pepsi
Bitch you was supposed to correct me
Been texting you since three, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you going in those knee-high boots, cut it out bitch
I doubt that you're going to house sit in that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say ""don't come over"" 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing
Why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing by

All the early Roman kings
In their sharkskin suits
Bow ties and buttons
High top boots
Drivin' the spikes in
Blazin' the rails
Nailed in their coffins
In top hats and tails
Fly away, little bird
Fly away, flap your wings
Fly by night
Like the early Roman kings

All the early roman kings
In the early early morn
Coming down the mountain
Distributing the corn
Speeding through the forest
Racing down the track
You try to get away
They drag you back
Tomorrow is Friday
We'll see what it brings
Everybody's talking
Bout the early roman kings

They're peddlers and they're meddlers
They buy and they sell
They destroyed your city
They'll destroy you as well
They're lecherous and treacherous
Hell-bent for leather
Each of 'em bigger
Than all them put together
Sluggers and muggers
Wearing fancy gold rings
All the women goin' crazy
For the early Roman kings

I can dress up your wounds
With a blood-clotted rag
I ain't afraid to make love
To a bitch or a hag
If you see me comin'
And you're standing there
Wave your handkerchief
In the air
I ain't dead yet
Ma Bell still rings
I keep my fingers crossed
Like them early roman kings

I can strip you of life
Strip you of breath
Ship you down
To the house of death
One day
You will ask for me
There'll be no one else
That you'll wanna see
Bring down my fiddle
Tune up my strings
I'm gonna break it wide open
Like the early roman kings

I was up on black mountain
The day Detroit fell
They killed 'em all off
And they sent 'em to hell
Ding dong daddy
You're coming up short
Gonna put you on trial
In a Sicilian court
I've had my fun
I've had my flings
Gonna shake em all down
Like the early roman kings

She wants a nice surprise

Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling

[Eminem:]
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time
I'm super human, my world is like a Rubik's cube
It's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
My mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'm a lay here just spooning yo
Oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
Diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down to my soul, from my head to my toe...
Ever since I was thirteen I learned how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'm a set this bitch on fire
And this time I don't mean I'm a pour gasoline on some chick and light her
Cause this time when I fuck this world I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
I'm go get Nickel and try to rip it wider

[Chorus:]
Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Classical poems
Battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn
Stabbing my clavicle bone
I'm matador prone
First time I seen a desert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
The 44 pop
First time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
Looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
In order to clean my veins you need saline
I'm never referring to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
Get respect from the get-go, hello
Set to the echo, psycho
Pen got a mind of it's own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati
As the petrol swallows,
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,
Right now I'm living a dream
Though we may be reckless
The ladies check us
They whisper ""Shady Records""
Baby echo

[Chorus:]
Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Of ev'ry man who put me here

From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now

They say ev'ry man needs protection
They say ev'ry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

The well is dry and the stream runs shallow
And the sun is high and the field lies fallow
My tongue is tied and my body aching
Now I'm open wide and afraid of breaking

The food is hot and the table's ready
But my stomach's knots make my hands unsteady
So I take to pacing up and down the room
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's consumed

I just want to be part of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light in your eyes
I just want to be part of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light in your eyes

The bed is made and the candles burning
All our games are played and the clock keeps turning
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting
And the daggers stick as the doors keep shutting

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all

And there is no one there to dry your tears

Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto

I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
I love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me

Ever since you walked right in the circle's been complete
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul

You gave me babies, one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood

It's never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.

Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone

One more hour burns
So scared of his return
That I can't sleep tonight
In this hospital light

You call a tragedy
Is just another day to me
For my heart beats with fear 
As his footsteps draw near

The life I meant to lead
Won't slip away from me..

'Cuz this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough

You break me, and as I bleed
You just say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies 
Are not enough
This time..

There's nothing left of this
Your wispered words and empty threats
Rip away the seams of what I thought this would be
The last thread has come undone
To reveal what I've become
Another victim of a poison love

I've been afraid for years
But that won't keep me here..

'Cuz this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough

You break me 
To just say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies
Are not enough
This time..

What remains a mystery
You can not have the best of me
So I'm taking back 
All you took from me

'Cuz this time is the last time
I know that my eyes have seen too much
This nightmare is not fair
And I've had enough

You break me 
To just say you're sorry
You call this love?
But this time your lies
Are not enough
This time..

Hear that old train whistle
howling in the night
If that flyer's southbound
Everything will be all right

Don't nobody tell me

If she's been unfaithful
I don't know what I'll do

Never thought that I could miss her so

Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Yeah)
Too late
(I can't keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase
25 to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side (Yeah)
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
'Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side?
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time?
You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh
Now I'm special? I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
It's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
You're addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list

Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And it's just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late
Caught in a chase
25 to life

I was afraid

letting someone in

till someone's arms
caught me by surprise
I never knew
the power of love that I suppose
deep in every heart
there's a part that knows
listen to it's voice
for it whispers what your dreams are made of
so why be afraid of
what you know is true
every day you learn
leading with your heart
can lift you higher
where your hearts desire
will be waiting for you
follow what you feel
feelings are wise
believe your heart
as you believe your eyes
and like a child
who's wandered off and lost its way
you can find a place
where you soul believes
that your home to stay
follow what you feel
anywhere it goes

Twist and they turn
As they ride with the tide

I begin to think of what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and I began to run
I made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtake me down in Jericho.

Standing on a corner as he's ringing my bell
Up stepped the sherrif of Thomasville
He said, ""Young man, is you name Brown ?
Remember you blowed little Sadie down ?"".

""Oh yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in first degree""
""First degree and second degree
If you've got any papers, will you serve 'em to me ?"".

Well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one for to go my bail
They crammed me back into the crowded jail

Well, the judge and the jury they took their stand

Tell me a piece of your history
that you're proud to call your own
Speak in words you picked up
 as you walked through life alone
We used to swim in your stories
 and be pulled down by their tide
Choking on the water, drowning, with no air in sight

Now you've hit a wall and it's not your fault
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard,
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words in that head of yours
And oh, oh can you feel the silence?
I can't take it anymore
Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill the silence?

Tell me a piece of your history 
that you've never said out loud
Pull the rug beneath my feet 
and shake me to the ground
Wrap me around your fingers,
break the silence open wide
Before it seeps into my ears
and fills me up from the inside

Now you've hit a wall and you're lost for words
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words in that head of yours
And oh, oh can you feel the silence?
I can't take it anymore
'Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill the silence?

If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?

I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge.
Ric is a blues guitarplayer. I met him one day on
The green pastures of the Harvard University

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you ?
Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
If you just let me come home with you

Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world

"
2968,Bob Dylan,,Caribbean Wind - Rehearsal With Pedal Steel,,"

She was from Haiti, fair brown and intense
I don't think she'd ever known about innocence
I was playing a show in Miami, in the theater of mystery
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the vision, told me about the pain
That had risen from the ashes and abided in her memory

Was she a virtuous woman? I really can't say
Something about her said ""Trust me anyway""
As the days turned into minutes and the minutes turned back into hours
Pretended to be sleeping, and he thought I was
But I was only paying attention like a rattlesnake does
When he's hearing footsteps trampling on the flowers

The Caribbean winds still blow, from Mexico to Curacao 
From Chinatown to the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on the iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everyone that's near to me closer to the fire

Our shadows grew closer till they touched on the floor
Prodigal sons waiting close to the door
Preaching obscenities, waiting for the night to arrive
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
She had left him to die in there 
But I knew I couldn't get him out while he still was alive

The stars on the balcony, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan's broken, there's heat in my bed
Street band playing ""Nearer, My God, to Thee""
She looked into my eyes, I hear them mission bells ring
She said ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
""You can do about it so you might as well let it be""

And them Caribbean winds still blow, from Mexico down to Curacao
From Chinatown to the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything you'd ever want close to me closer to the fire

Atlantic city by the cruel sea, I hear a voice crying ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me
But it's only the silence in the Buttermilk Hills that calls
Every new messenger bringing evil reports
'Bout armies that are rioting whose fuses are short
And them ugly gargoyles and hate words written on walls

Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids, fire in her clothes
But the curtain was rising, like they say, the show must go on
And I felt you come over me, some kind of gloom
I was gonna say ""Come on with me, I've got plenty of room""
But I knew I'd be lying, and besides she had already gone

And them Caribbean winds still blow, from Curacao to Mexico
From Chinatown to the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty, on iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire

Oh well, I, John, he saw might numbers
A way up in the middle of the air
I, John he saw might numbers
Way in the middle of the air
Got to mighty move, John, you saw mighty numbers
Way up in the middle of the air

Well there were three gates in the east
And there were three gates in the west
Three gates in the north
Three gates in the south
And that makes twelve gates to the city all square wide

John, you saw might numbers way up in the middle of the air
Well John declared that he saw a man
He held twelve bright stars in his right hand
Well his eyes flashed fire like the burning sun
Old John got scared and he wanted to run
Well he wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go
Cause he felt the gospel cutting like a two-edged sword
And he heard a voice that said John, you take a look
And read what you see and then you write it in a book

And he saw twelve angels in the east
And there were twelve angels in the west
Twelve angels in the north,
Twelve angels in the south
That's a total of forty-eight angels to the city, four squared wide

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
The sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I’m into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
The shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

Heals a broken heart

Hey there it's good to see you again,
It never felt right calling this ""just friends"".
I'm happy, if you're happy, with yourself.

Take off your shirt, your shoes, 
those skinny jeans I bought for you.
We're diving in, there's nothing left to lose.

I'm gonna break down these walls, (down these walls) I built around myself.
I wanna fall so in love (so in love), with you, and no one else,
Could ever mean half as much, to me as you do now.
Together we'll move on, just don't turn around,
Let the walls break down.

I used to wear you like a ball and chain,
I'd run and hide at the call of my name.
It was obvious you were too much for me.
Oblivious, I was young and horny.

In retrospect, I wouldn't do it again.
Stop talking shit to every one of your friends
I'm not the same boy you knew back then...

'Cause I can break down these walls, I built around myself.
I wanna fall so in love, with you, and no one else,
Could ever mean half as much, to me as you do now.
Together we'll move on, just don't turn around,
Let the walls break 

I can't breathe, my body's shaking.
You've got a way with the way you take me,
'Cause you break me down,
You know you break me down...

I'm gonna break down these walls, (down these walls) I built around myself.
I wanna fall so in love, (so in love) with you, and no one else,
Could ever mean half as much, to me as you do now.

Break down these walls, I built around myself.
Let the walls break down. (break down these walls)

Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it's probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

Ooh, up in the V-I, sitting on a chair
Ooh, that's when I saw her sitting over there
She was chilling with her girlfriends (Yeah)
I was chilling with my homies (Yeah)
Then she made her over to my table (Whoa)
And she started dancing all on me
I should've said, ""Hold up,"" (Hold up)
""Don't you know my girl?""

She saw me out with an other girl

Now I'm thinking, oh, what I'm gonna say to her when I get home (And I've been drinking)
Man, the way that her girlfriend was staring at me, I know she got it wrong
And I know she see me out on the floor (Yeah)
And it was only a dance nothing more (Yeah)
I'm thinking, maybe, I could be wrong
Wondering why she calling me on my phone
I should've said, ""Hold up, I got a girl.""

I was just getting some air
Didn't know she would be up in the club, no

She keep calling me, but I know I don't wanna do wrong

We should make it worth the while

Well, I took me a woman late last night
I's three-fourths drunk she looked all right
'Til she started peelin' off her onion gook
She took off her wig, said, ""How do I look""?
I's high flyin', bare naked... Out the window

Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side
(She's a tryin' a hide pretendin'
She don't know me)

I's out there paintin' on the old wood shed
When a can a black paint it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
(Cost a quarter
Half price)

Well, my telephone rang it would not stop
It's President Kennedy callin' me up
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow""?
I said, ""My friend, John, ""Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren""
Country'll grow

Well, I got a woman five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts
She tickles my nose pats me on the head
Blows me over and kicks me out of bed
(She's a man eater
Meat grinder
Bad loser)

Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' alla time
I got a woman who works herself blind
Works up to her britches, up to her neck
Write me letters and sends me checks
(She's a humdinger
Folk singer)

Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air raid drill
(I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped the string bean
I jumped the TV dinner
I jumped the shot gun)

Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people
(He's eatin' bagels
He's eatin' pizza
He's eatin' chitlins)

Oh, set me down on a television floor
I'll flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
(Greasy kid stuff
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays
Martin Luther King
Olatunji)

Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow a moustache on my face
(She's insane)

Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
(I catch dinosaurs
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

Let me paint this picture for you, baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see

6478,Panic! At The Disco,,First Try,,"

This town just wasn't made for two
But when the streets they call my name, what can I do?
There's a place I'd like to visit there someday
And if you decline my invitation, what can I say?
What can I say?
What can I say?

When the corner light has dimmed upon the street
And all the faces looked confused on those you meet
Tell your friends that I'll be dead when you read this
Tell them I couldn't take the pain of loneliness
Of loneliness...
Of loneliness...

I am feeling low
And I'm singing in my sleep when you're around; will you comfort me?
I'll dream of you
And the smile that you give to me
You give to me...
You give to me...

It's the same thing everyday
Because we run out of things to say
If you're gone and me not here
It kind of sheds a different light on the whole year
On the whole year...
On the whole year...

I am feeling good
And I'm singing in my sleep when you're around; will you comfort me?
I'll dream of you
And the smile that you give to me
You give to me...
You give to me...
You give to me...

802,All Time Low,,Good Times (Orchestral Arrangement),,"

On a fault line late night
Underneath the stars we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times

While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

We were bare knuckle tight lip
Turn the music up ego trip
Devil-may-care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times

With the boys in black chasing silhouettes
Of the girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed, when we cried
Those were the days we owned the nights
Locked away, lost in time
I found the nerve to say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
(Won't forget the good times)
I won't forget the good times
(Won't forget the good times)

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word and carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times

I done lost my ugly spare
I am cheerful now got the warmth all over
To smother my worried brow
Oh the girl I use to be
She ain't me no more
I closed the door on the girl I was before
Feeling fine and full of bliss
What I really wanna say is this
I never has seen snow
All the same I know
Snow ain't so beautiful
Can't be so beautiful
Like my love is
Like my love is
Nothing do compare
Nothing any where with my love
A hundred things I see
A twilight sky that tree
But none so beautiful
Not one so beautiful
Like my love is
Like my love is
Once you see his face
None can take the place of my love
A stone rolled of my heart
When I laid my eyes on that
Near of me boy with that far away look
And right from the start I saw a new horizon
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took
Needed to be took
Needed to be took
Oh!
I never have seen snow
All the same I know
Nothing will ever be
Nothing can ever be
Beautiful as my love is
Like my love is to me
Nothing is as beautiful
To me

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip hip hooray love

Photographs in sepia tones
So still the fire is barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
But the cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
And, baby, you will never be lost on me

This is a God damn shame
I never wanted to break it
And leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

The car was stuck, the engine stalled
Both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever know
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us

You were the first full stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

On the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
I've seen and I've done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
I'd be on that train tomorrow
I'll be home on Christmas day

And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh, too many tears fell
My soul fills with yearning
If I had sense at all
I'd just be on my way
Be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day

Everytime I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And I'd be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day

If I had any sense at all

I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day

I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will""

I'm a long way away from where you are in skill
Foreign wheels, my bitch wearin' four-inch heels
She on the orange pill
And she about to start taking off layers like orange peels
Sacha Baron Cohen, Ferrell, where am I going with this?
Oh yeah, I bar at will
And when you throw the iron in it, I'm all that still
The truth for real, I'm real true, call that trill
This is my house, this place is mine
Posted on any corner on any coast I'm on
You niggas need to leave that lean, Henny, and coke alone
Terror to the business, married to the strippers, T-Pain
Student of the game pre-Kane, you niggas Post Malone
Elite beat boxer minus the raps
Rollin' with at least three choppers, Ryan is that
I literally keep three shottas
I'm lyrically James Todd, Tariq Trotter minus the cap

Manslaughter goons under the moonlight
John Wilkes, that's who I'm in the booth like
Ayy, bruh, I go ham for dead presidents
And everything I record is over your head like a boom mic
Why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us
Knowing your Smith & Wesson has never been clutched?
Knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented
Them niggas that'll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks
Your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever
I see you, my niggas call me ""The Enemy Watcher""
The minute we spot ya, the semi'll pop, nigga, we got ya
I'm livin' to conquer, remember the mantra, I'm grippin' the launcher
Like Em and the Doctor with no guilty conscience
I'm still shockin' like droppin' a boombox in bathwater
More shockin' than a pissed off Blanka

I just finished fuckin' a fish called Wanda
I'm finna wander off into yonder
Beyond just mentally stronger, memory monster
I remember the sponsorin' thought that conquered his triple entendre
You the cross of a unicorn and The Unabomber
Quit horsin' around in this building or you a goner
Your Willy Wonka persona won't help you any longer
I'm Optimus, I make prime examples of mini-Tonkas
Hogtie your squad and go bonkers

Now this will probably be the most illest shit that I've ever said
God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school,"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just suns in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So Lord forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning

I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will

My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever it could be, makes me think you've seen me before
Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena

Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
I've tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, you're down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?

She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearin' a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God's truth tell me what you want and you'll have it of course
Just step into the arena

Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weepin' in unholy places

I can’t wait much longer till you tell me baby
There’s some chance we’ll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I’ll be in with half a chance
I can’t wait till I hear you tell me that you want me 
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me 
Got my demons doing such a happy dance

Hey! Ah! Yeah!

Exorcise my demons, cast them out today 
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there’s a chance
I don’t want to sit and watch my demons dance

Watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance
Oh no, demons dance

Girl I want you to do it

Do you have to put me through these complications 
When you know I try hard not to be wrong 

But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist

Ah, ah, ah

I can’t wait much longer till you tell me baby
There’s a chance we’ll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I’ll be in with half a chance

Got my demons doing such a happy dance

Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there’s half a chance

Pass me a drink
You say it’s gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile

You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette

You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

I’ve taken the blow
It’s all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no ‘see you later’

You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile

You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette

You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

Oh, for you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for you
For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody to love

Every day, I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime (Last dime)
Step to the beat of my heart

I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you
I admit I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine

[Usher with Justin Bieber:]
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, girl
But what I really want, I can't find
'Cause money can't find me
Somebody to love
Find me somebody to love, oh

Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories, sweetened through the ages just like wine

Quiet thoughts come floating down
And settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touched them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Sweet memories

Of holding hands and red bouquets
And twilight trimmed in purple haze
And laughing eyes and simple ways
And quiet nights and gentle days with you

Memories, pressed between the pages of my mind

Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl

Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (give)

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my love on over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks are dancing, there are all shook up

And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear them play a tango
And In The Mood they take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Couldn't make any plans
To conceal me

Open your sensitive mouth
Hold out your delicate hands
With such a sensitive mouth

When I rush
I rush for you

Cry for you
Seen the tears
Roll down from my eyes for you
Heard my truth
Distorted to lies for you
Watched my love
Becoming a prize for you

Seen the tears in my eyes
Heard my truth turn to lies
Seen the tears in my eyes
I'm not proud of what I do
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you

I come up to meet you
Up there somewhere
When I rush to greet you
My soul is bared

Gave more for you
Dropped my crutches
And crawled on the floor for you
Went looking behind every door for you
And because of the things
That I saw for you
I spiritually grew
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you

You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say, ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says, ""Well what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God
Am I here all alone?""

But something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, ""How does it feel
To be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone

And something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known

But something is happening here
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""

And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""NOW""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back, ""You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home""

And you know something's happening
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

'Cause something is happening
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen, I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve
The rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment's due
Exceeds accounts received, at seventeen

To those of us who knew the pain
Of Valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen

Don't tell me not to live
Just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's
A ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade
Don't tell me not to fly

If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed

I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it!
But whether I'm the rose
Of sheer perfection
Or freckle on the nose
Of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye
I gotta fly once
I gotta try once
Only can die once, right, sir?
Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy, and you'll see
I'm gonna have my bite, sir!
Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a ""comer""
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade!
I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want, I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw, that bell will go clang
Eye on the target, and wham
One shot, one gun shot, and bam
Hey, Mister Arnstein, here I am!

I'll march my band out
I will beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir

East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine

To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I got to do
To be making a change, now the moment of truth

Why am I feeling so nervous?
When things are going so perfect and
Now I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you

And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I'll ask you, tonight, will you marry me?

A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Arms holding me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our life

Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed

What a wonderful way, to fall in deeper in with you

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay
Alright, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight
Yo, yo
Alright, I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, my mom
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day, I'd have at least three stomach aches
Now, tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fucking seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleeping
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait 'til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid""

My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on

'Cause my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh

Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually
What has ended up happening, a tragedy
The fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
But I don't need it ""Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though

Cruising up the boulevard

Complains about the gas prices, but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think it's genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
So he does sh— to make it better

Everybody wants Heaven

Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh, little does she know
That there's a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause she continues to ignore, but she's like the TV
The story repeats, yeah
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news
She's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Thinks it's a waste of time to vote
She says the world has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I'm thinking who

Everybody wanna touch the sky (Ooh)
And nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants Heaven (Heaven)

I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin'
Wearin' nothin' but a button and a bow

Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying

She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show

Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying

She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Yeah, but let me tell you people
Little Egypt doesn't dance there anymore
She's too busy mopping
And a-takin' care of shopping at the store
'Cause we've got seven kids
And all day long they crawl around the floor

I hear a bird
Londonderry bird
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word
I hear a breeze
A river Shannon breeze
It well may be it's followed me across the seas
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye
Come whistling by?
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?

So I ask each weeping willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad that comes a whistling
'Toora-lay'
How are things in Glocca Morra
This fine day?

The mist of May is in the gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'
Through the heather on the hill

The mornin' dew is blinking yonder
There's lazy music in the rill
And all I want to do is wander
Through the heather on the hill

There may be other days as rich and rare
There may be other springs as full and fair
But they won't be the same, they'll come and go
But this I must know

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that laddie calling 'toora-lay'?
Will we meet in Glocca Morra
Some fine day? Some fine day

And if I have nothing left to show
Tears on my pillow

If God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

In the barrio, all the streets are paved with fear

How much heartache?
How many suns will they have to burn?

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight, but we cannot win this blind
Stand your guns against the wall
Who's next in line to fall?

There are songs that sound like movies
There are themes that fill the screen
There are lines I say that sound as if they're written
There are looks I wear the theater should have seen
But though I've made my life a movie
The matinee must end by five
And I must stagger out into the blinding sunlight half alive
Wishing I were back inside the picture show
There where it's always night
Notice how the screen is wide
The second role I've said around too tight
Will I stay? Yes, I might
Oh widescreen wider on my eyes
Lie my mind with lies
Find the world like nothing that I've seen
Oh widescreen dreams are just my sighs
As we walk from out the movie
Are we acting out a scene
Does the orchestra play chords
When we start loving?
Do we move just like slow motion
On the screen?
Life's a constant disappointment
When you live on celluloid
But my movie expectations are a dream I can't avoid
Waiting for a man to say the things
That I heard in the film last night
But he doesn't want to play the role
And he can't pick his cues up right
Will I dream? Yes, I might!
Oh widescreen winding round my eyes
Blinding me with lies
Finding I've been fooled by what I've seen
No, widescreen dreams are more than you
How can lies be true?
All we have is life and mind
And love we find with a friend

We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing

It's a helluva feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a helluva feeling though
It's a helluva feeling though

Who are these people?
I just woke up in my underwear
No liquor left on the shelf
I should prob'ly introduce myself
You shoulda seen what I wore
I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand
Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five-thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough
(Don't think I'll ever get enough!)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying, ""If you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe.""
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

It's a helluva feeling though
It's a helluva feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a helluva feeling though
It's a helluva feeling though

What are these footprints?
They don't look very human-like
Now I wish that I could find my clothes
Bed sheets and a morning rose
I wanna wake up
Can't even tell if this is a dream
How did we end up in my neighbor's pool
Upside down with a perfect view?
Bar to bar at the speed of sound
Fancy feet dancing through this town
Lost my mind in a wedding gown
Don't think I'll ever get it now
(Don't think I'll ever get it now)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying, ""If you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe.""
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

I'm a scholar and a gentleman
And I usually don't fall when I try to stand
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I've told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
And we all fell down
When the sun came up
I think we've had enough

Alright, alright, it's a helluva feeling though
It's a helluva feeling though
Alright, alright, it's a helluva feeling though
It's a helluva feeling though

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up
Saying, ""If you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe.""
Oh yeah, don't threaten me with a good time

What good am I some like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
What good am I ? 

What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunderin' sky
What good am I ?

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
What good am I ?

What good am I then to others and me
If I had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been.

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I ?

Broken bottles broken plates
Broken switches broken gates

Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken.

Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground
Broken cutters broken saws
Broken buckles broken laws
Broken bodies broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath feel like you're chokin'
Everything is broken.

Things fall to pieces in my face
Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties broken vows
Broken pipes broken tools
People bending broken rules

Too much of nothing

While another man's temper might freeze

We cannot mock a soul
Oh, when there's too much of nothing 
No one has control.

Say hello to Vivian 
Give them all my salary

When there's too much of nothing 
It can cause a man to weep
He can walk the streets and boast like 
Of what he'd like to keep
But it's all been done before 
It's all been written in the book
And where there's too much of nothing 
Nobody should look.

Say hello to Valerie 
Say hello to Vivian 
Give them all my salary

And too much of nothing can make a man a liar
It can cause one man to sleep on nails 
It can cause others to eat fire
Everybody's doin' somethin' 
I heard it in a dream
But when there's too much of nothing 
It just makes a fella mean.

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really feel like I'm rolling for delf like Philly
Feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating, and I'm debating
On leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see I'm grievin'
I try and hide it
But I can't. Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying
I am finally realizing I need help
Can't do it myself. Too weak. Two weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallying 'round with the idea of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin' my reflection. I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah. I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck. Only thing I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes and I might see her
Shit

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you
Marshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?
And you falling off with your skills?
And your own fans are laughin' at you?
It become a problem. You're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand. A real man would've had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
""Yeah, Em, tight verse. You killed it.""
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gon' do whatever I says when I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend. So, fuck it, I guess then

I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
I'm going through changes
(But I just keep on going through changes)

My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you. What you want me to do?
I'm startin' to live like a recluse
And the truth is
Fame's startin' to give me an excuse
To be at a all-time low
I sit alone in my home theater watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour. The last tour he was still alive
And it hurts. So, I fast forward. Sleepin' pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I'll just take a couple more. Yeah, you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma. Yeah, homie, come on dole 'em out
""Daddy, don't you die on me. Daddy, better hold your ground.""
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice?
Yeah, baby hold me down

I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
I'm going through changes
(But I just keep on going through changes)

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pullin' through
Swear when I come back I'mma be bulletproof
I'mma do it just for Proof. I think I should state a few
Facts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?
I think about the things I would've never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right. So, here's what I came to do
Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina, too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day. We just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything: I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours. Yes, it does
Wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placin' any blame
I ain't pointin' fingers. Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say
""I miss you"" subconsciously. Wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away. Don't know why
I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm

I'm going through changes
(Don't know what I'm gonna do)
I'm going through changes

4420,Elvis Presley,,Separate Ways,,"

I see a change is coming to our lives
It's not the same as it used to be
And it's not too late to realize our mistake
We're just not right for each other

Love has slipped away left us only friends
We almost seem like strangers
All that's left between us are the memories we shared
Of times we thought we cared for each other

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Some day when she's older
maybe she will understand
Why her mom and dad are not together
The tears that she will cry when 
I have to say goodbye
Will tear at my heart forever

There's nothing left to do but go our separate ways
And pick up all the pieces left behind us
And maybe someday, somewhere along the way
Another love will find us

Here as I lay beside you, I know
How grateful my heart feels
Knowing that you've come
In my world to stay
Now I know my life has finally begun
That dream, that's promised everyone
Now when the world around me looks gray
I look into your eyes and all the darkness goes
I can find my way
Finally I know I'm never alone
A light inside will lead me home
Remember it's all there is
Remember it's all there was
The answer is right here in our hands
And know if our hearts are true
There's nothing we have to do
You and me for always
Now when I wake each morning I say
No need to look ahead
Leave the past behind
Here's a brand new day
Suddenly my life is perfectly clear
The love we found was always here
Remember it's all there is
Remember it's all there was
The answer is right here in our hands
And know if our hearts are true
There's nothing we have to do
You and me for always
Never ending, never changing
The answer is here in our hands
Always reaching , always climbing
You and me for always
Ever loving, ever lasting
The answer is here in our hands
Always changing, always loving...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?

And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her

What happens when you become the main source of her pain?

And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...

Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. ""Daddy, you're lying.
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine.""

It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you.""

These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying, ""You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.""

But, baby, wait.
""It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""

Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her,
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

When you play it hard, and I try to follow you there.
It's not about control but I turn back when I see where you go.

Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough

[A$AP Rocky:]
A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Ciprianis
Like Beyoncé they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying 'til she's sound asleep (sleep)
Preach (preach), pray (pray) that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you're not the only one

[Sam Smith:]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though God knows you have mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[A$AP Rocky:]
We all guilty of the same crime if you ask me
I might've had a couple women at the same time
But she can't do the pressure, Jack Daniel's for breakfast
A cap of Valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
'Til I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit

[Sam Smith:]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feeding, darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone but no one's leaving, nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feeling but we never feel it, riding on our last train home
Dying in our sleep, we're living out a dream, we only make it out alone

I just keep on hoping that you call me
You say you wanna see me but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losing something that we never found
We're running out of reasons but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding but we call it home

Outside the winter sky turning grey
City up in smoke it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the morning, blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all the eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now, they closing in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo
Wish I could go, I'm losing hope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

I just keep on hoping that you call me
You say you wanna see me but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losing something that we never found

6496,Panic! At The Disco,,Round Here,,"

Step out the front door like a ghost
Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white
And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

Round here we always stand up straight
Round here something radiates

Well Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
It's like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house
Takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands

Ohhh....
Sleeping children better run like the wind
out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
out of the lightning

She says ""it's only in my head""
She says ""Shhh I know it's only in my head""
She said ""did you think that you were dreaming?""
I said ""no""
""Did you think that you were dreaming""
I said ""no""
""Did you think that you were dreaming""
I said ""sometimes I don't know""

There's a girl on the car out in the parking lot
And she says ""come on, ya know come on just take a shot
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
Can't you see my walls are tumbling down?
Can't you see my walls are crumbling down?
Can't you see my sun stop spinning around
Can't you see the sky turn black and brown
Can't you see the moon is flashing round
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
Can't you see me
No

There's a girl on the car out in the parking lot
""Can't you see my walls are crumbling down?""
Then she looks up at the building
Says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

Round here she's always on my mind
Round here hey man got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early
and nobody makes us wait
Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late
I can't see nothing.. nothing round here
So will you catch if I'm falling
Will you catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun round here
Man I said I'm under the gun round here
And I can't see nothing
Nothing round here

Complicating, circulating

Transitions to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen now show me

Your face is hidden and were out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answers nowhere

Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I
Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
""Equality,"" I spoke their word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now.

I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon

It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn't it be lovely

I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate

I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift

A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe

Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon

I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
And some absynthe drunk so late

The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate

Crickets are chirpin' the water is high
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry
Window wide open African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye not even a note
She gone with the man in the long black coat.

Somebody seen him hangin' around
As the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the bible he'd quote
There was dust on the man in the long black coat.

Preacher was talking there's a sermon he gave
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it's you who must keep it satisfied
It ain't easy to swallow it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat.

There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don't live or die people just float
She went with the man in the long black coat.

There's smoke on the water it's been there since June
Tree trunks unprooted beneath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse
She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man in the long black coat.

When the night
Is wrapped around us
And the dawn might come too soon
When the only light
That's found us
Is the solitary moon

When the songbird in a willow
Sings a soft
And songs from two
Once again
You share my pillow
Making love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon

[Bridge:]
As it slowly sails above us
In it's solitary flight
Seems the moon
Must shurely love us
As it based us in it's flight

Say that we can spent the day
Through a sunlet afternoon
Let your kisses
Say you stay here
And make love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon.

2976,Bob Dylan,,"Farewell, Angelina",,"

Farewell Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits,
I must follow the sound

The triangle tingles,
The music plays slow,
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire and I must go

There is no use in talking
And no need for blame,
There is nothing to prove,
Everything still is the same

A table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
But farewell Angelina,
The sky is changing colors
And I must leave

The Jacks and the Queens,
They forsake the courtyard,
Fifty-Two gypsies now file past the guard

In the space where the Deuce and the Ace once ran wild,
Farewell Angelina,
The sky is folding,
I'll see you after a while

See the cross-eyed pirates sit pirched in the sun,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed off shot gun,
And the corporals and neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
But farewell Angelina,
The sky, it is trembling
And I must leave fast

King Kong, little elves
In the rooftops, they dance
Valentino type tangos while the heroes clean hands

Shut the eyes of the dead,
Not to embarrass anyone,
Farewell Angelina,
The sky is flooding over and I must be gone

The camouflaged parrot,
He flutters from fear,
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears

What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Farewell Angelina,
The sky is flooding over and I must go where it is dry

Machine guns are roaring,
Puppets heave rocks,
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks

Call me any name you like,
I will never deny it,
But farewell Angelina,
The sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet

Crying out that he was framed

Chained to the wheel until I am dead

And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand

Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame 
And holds me down until it is through
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, still I stand

That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again

Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow

All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone

Still I hear her own sweet song

And ditties romantic drive me nearly frantic

History's making, nations are quaking
Why sing of stars above
For while we are waiting father time's creating
New things to be singing of

Sing me a song with social significance
All other tunes are taboo
I want a ditty with heat in it,
Appealing with feeling and meat in it!

Sing me a song with social significance
Or you can sing 'til you're blue
Let meaning shine from ev'ry line
Or I won't love you

Sing me of wars and sing me of breadlines
Tell me of front page news
Sing me of strikes and last minute headlines
Dress your observation in syncopation!

Sing me a song with social significance
There's nothing else that will do
It must get hot with what is what
Or I won't love you.

I want a song that's satirical
And putting the mere into miracle
It must be packed with social fact
or I won't love you

Sing me of kings and conf'rences martial
Tell me of mills and mines
Sing me of courts that aren't impartial
What's to be done with 'em tell me in rhythm

When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about

But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?

And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I—

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

But I keep walkin' the line

You have dreams, if you act
They will come true
To turn your dreams to a fact,
It' s up to you!
If you have the soul and the spirit
Never fear it, you'll see it through
Hearts can inspire other hearts, with their fire
For the strong obey
When a strong man shows them the way
Give me some men
Who are stout-hearted men
Who will fight for the right they adore
Start me with ten,
Who are stout-hearted men
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more

Shoulder to shoulder
And bolder and bolder
They grow as they go to the fore!

Then there's nothing in the world
Can halt or mar a plan
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man...

Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A giant creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me here I am my arms are open wide

Somewhere in the middle of the neverending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the clamour of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot

I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be

People feed me with their lives I am a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh

I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear
And the air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city you let me be

The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me

2805,Bob Dylan,1992.0,Jim Jones,"""Good As I Been To You""","

Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang"", says he
""And after that Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones"".

And our ship was high upon the sea
When pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales
There's no time for mischief there they say
Remember that, says they
Or they'll flog the poaching out of you
Down there in Botany Bay.

Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bravest rankers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the floggers down
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock
Remember what I say
They'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay.

[Che:]
In June of forty-three there was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U.
Who did not feel the need to be elected

They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Atilla the Hun
A bomb or two and very few objected

Yeah, just one shell and governments fall like flies, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet rule as democracy dies

The lady's got potential, she was setting her sights
On making it in movies with her name in lights
The greatest social climber since Cinderella

OK, she couldn't act but she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella to be stellar

Yeah, just one shell and governments lose their nerve, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
That's how we get the government we deserve

Now the man behind the President calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Peron, would-be dictator

He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later

Yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die
They haven't a chance, bye bye
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Peron was biding time out in the slow lane

Yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of San Juan, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Keep away from the wall
But one guy was having a ball
The tragedy, a golden chance for Peron

He organized a concert with incredible flair
In aid of all the victims, such a grand affair
Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor

It was January twenty-second, 1944
A night to remember, yeah, that's for sure
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva

Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done

Show me the meaning of being lonely

Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart (heart!)

There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)

I had a dream I was mugged outside your house
I had a dream in a panic you came running out
For a moment you were sure I'd die on you
For a moment I believed you loved me too
But life is never like this, and you were never strong

Too much of a good thing, won't be good for long.
Although you made my heart sing
To stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing, won't be good anymore.
Watch where I tread before I fall

We talk maybe twenty times a day
And still I never say what I want to say
I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

Too much of a good thing, won't be good for long.
Although you made my heart sing
To stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing, won't be good anymore.
Watch where I tread before I fall

You refuse to see this, don't see it anymore
I have made the decision, not to answer your calls
Cause I put everything out there and I got
Nothing at all

Too much of a good thing isn't good and you know
I watch where I walk before I fall
Before I fall

2843,Bob Dylan,2001.0,Floater,"""Love And Theft""","

Down over the window
From the dazzling sunlit rays
through the back alleys, through the blinds
another one of them endless days

Honey bees are buzzing
leaves begin to stir
I'm in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her

I keep listening for footsteps
but I ain't never hearing any
from the boat, I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many

A summer breeze is blowin'
a squall is setting in
sometimes it's just plain stupid
to get into any kind of wind

Well the old men 'round here
sometimes they get on bad terms
with the younger men,
old, young, age don't carry weight
it doesn't matter in the end

One of the boss' hangers-on
Sometimes comes to call
At times you least expect
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,
inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect

There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
the old one is long gone
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across
Burns with the bark still on

They say times are hard
if you don't believe it you can follow your nose
it don't bother me, times are hard anywhere
we'll just have to see how it goes

My old man, he's like some feudal lord
he's got more lives than a cat
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
things come alive or they fall flat

You can smell the pine wood burnin'
you can hear the school bell ring
got to get up near the teacher, if you can
if you wanna learn anything

Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion
it don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch
Juliet said back to Romeo,
why don't you just shove off,
if it bothers you so much

They got outta here any way they could
Cold rain can give you the shivers
they went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,
all the rest of them rebel rivers

If you ever try to interfere with me
or cross my path again,
you do so at the peril of your life
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound
I've seen enough heartache and strife

My grandfather was a duck trapper,
he could do it with just dragnets and ropes (?)
my grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.

I had 'em once, though I suppose
To go along with all the ring dancing,
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
buried under tobacco leaves

Not always easy kicking someone up
got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task
sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

Would the choices you made still be the same?
Like a flower that dies from angry rain,
Why do we hurt ourselves?

Where is the love that lets the sunlight in to start again?
The love that sees no color lines?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings & fly,
Guide your spirit safe & sheltered,
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

If ever a boy stood on the moon,
Carrying all of his treasures from the stars
To a rainbow which leads to where we are.
Together we'd chase the sun.

Where is the love that lifts my brother's voice to the skies?
The love that answers a mother's cry?
Life begins with love,
So spread your wings & fly,
Guide your spirit safe & sheltered.
A thousand dreams that we can still believe.

A boy stood on the moon
The ancient souls can still discover
A thousand dreams that we can still believe
That we can still believe
We can still believe
We can still believe

If I get home on Christmas day
I won't need soft words to say
I'll miss you and I can stay a while
You'll see it in my eyes and when I smile

If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day

Writing letters everyday
Never really seem to say
The way I feel deep in this heart of mine
Thought I'm half a world away
If we're patient and we pray
Know I'll get my chance with you this time

If I get home on Christmas day
I won't need soft words to say
I'll miss you and I can stay a while
You'll see it in my eyes and when I smile

If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day

74,ABBA,1980.0,Our Last Summer,"""Super Trouper""","

The summer air was soft and warm
The feeling right
The Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Élysées
We had a drink in each café

And you
You talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes

Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
'Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet you're the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam
'Round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer

That old black magic has weaved its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

Same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride
And down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love

I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

For you're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Under that old black magic called love

Cold winds may blow over the icy sea
But I'll take with me
The warmth of Thee
A taste of honey,
A taste much sweeter than wine

My heart to wear
And may it e?er remind you of
A taste of honey

Looking for beauty in a certain
Finding the strength inside a gray
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown
And maybe that's okay
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life
Maybe I need to get a grip
'Cause you're the only one
That makes me feel like this, so

Save me, I'm falling again
Keep me from breaking in a million pieces
In the end no matter what I do
There's nowhere, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go but you

Yeah-yeah (yeah-yeah)
Tryna make nothing outta something
Promised myself I wouldn't care
Baby you're making me a liar
'Cause I'm standing here
You're finally cracking my resistance
And found a way to wear me down
Yeah, I just look at you
And there's no way out, so

Come on now
Dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you

Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags

You didn't know me

You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away

Far away

You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again

And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you
I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still gone to pack my bags

You didn't know me

4771,Eminem,,Hellbound (H&H Remix),,"

Welcome back to the stage of history

(Yo, Slim Shady!)

Yo, I'll fuckin', I'll... I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to, The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you, I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

Am I the worst because I never go to church?
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R
Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot!
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me, but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

Maxi was seriously wounded
But the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare, 'cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

Time's up! You lose!

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh...

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I... I miss my baby

It was a dark day in Dallas, November '63
A day that will live on in infamy
President Kennedy was a-ridin' high
Good day to be livin' and a good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?""
""Of course we do, we know who you are!""
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll put it in your face
We've already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
Right there in front of everyone's eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed, skillfully done
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul

Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister, go get your coat
Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat
There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age
Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage
Put your head out the window, let the good times roll
There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
Stack up the bricks, pour the cement
Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President
Put your foot in the tank and let's step on the gas
Try to make it to the triple underpass
Blackface singer, whiteface clown
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red-light district, they got cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe
Don't ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
The place where faith, hope, and charity died
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye, Charlie! Goodbye, Uncle Sam
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
What is the truth, and where did it go?
Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know
""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl
Business is business, and it's a murder most foul

Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen
I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine
Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap
Hold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles
You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead
That magic bullet of yours has gone on my head
I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline
Never shot anyone from in front or behind
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
Zapruder's film I've seen night before
Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
They killed him once and they killed him twice
Killed him like a human sacrifice
The day that they killed him, someone said to me, ""Son
The age of the Antichrist has just only begun""
Air Force One comin' in through the gate
Johnson sworn in at 2:38
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
It is what it is, and it's murder most foul

What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?
I said that soul of a nation been torn away
And it's beginning to go into a slow decay
And that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day

I wonder when we're gonna shake it
Fire down below I'm just a regular dynamo
Want some smooth company
Don't lose control just hang on out with me
Got to get to know each other
But we got plenty of time
Did you hear the last call baby?

You and me got staying power yeah
You and me we got staying power

Power power power...

I wonder when we're gonna stick it
I wonder when we're gonna trick it
Blow baby blow let's get down and go go
Get yourself in the mood
Got to give a little bit of attitude

Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for ""Cleaning Out My Closet"", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though
'Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
'Cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my Ma

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say, ""Goodbye, cruel world.""
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Ah

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming,
I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man,
Well, it surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune,
But I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more no!

Carry on,
You will always remember
Carry on,
Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry,
Don't you cry no more,

No more!

No I won't

You know you're all alone, your friends, they aren't at home
Everybody's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees, you can look, but you don't see
Flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden? Yeah

Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost, no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without

You can find it all inside, no need to wrestle with your pride
No, you ain't losing your mind, you're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside for the garden

I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round for daze
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On this garden song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
It's a crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show you
But it sure was glad to know you

Bye-bye, so long, bye-bye
It's glad to know you
Bye-bye
Bye-bye

1457,Bastille,2012.0,Forever Ever,"mixtape: ""Other People's Heartache, Pt. 2""","

I don't wanna talk about it [8x]

I see ahead of me a light that takes my breath
If we're only ever looking back, then how can we expect
To see each other as we are, for all that we've become
Would be friends at all if we weren't friends when we was young?
And I want to feel close to you for more than just a sake,
Of the place that we grew up in and all them times that we got baked in the park
Look, if you take me apart, you'll find half of me is you but half of me is asking me to start anew

You look the same but I don't recognize you,
I'm looking you dead in the face and I can't find you
Don't like the way we always talk in the past tense,
Can't explain the present 'til you work out what the past meant

These are the days that bind us together, forever
And these little things define us, forever, forever

All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

There's a man I've known for years, and still to this day do I know him
I love him very much, it's very hard for me to show him
Back then and even now I feel there's something that I owe him
And that feeling should be going over time but no it's growing
We was kid mates, making mistakes, playing give take
Big hearts battling them big snakes, rattling their tails
He was like the wind in my sails, I was like the water for his keel, it was real
It use to hurt my flesh that his worn scars were heated still
He use to hurt his flesh just to see if he could feel
He took out a long straw, he was never really the strong sort
Got into the wrong sport, big swigs, long snorts
Caught in that spiral, saw attempts to help him sparkle
But soon he got so down that he got on the brown, word got around
People did not like the sound, they told me to stop popping round to see him
I kept disagreeing, soon he was a different being
He got into stealing, robbing, I still see him frequent afterwards you'd think would open eyes were throbbing
You could stop him freaking out, but to speak about the things that made him weak, his doubt
And to stop his rolling sentence, faced with paper pen to write his actions spoke dependence
Friendship became difficult to say the least, he played the beast so well
I wondered how I would ever make our peace
That's when we drifted, never argued, it just became clear
The parts of him I loved so well would slowly disappear

Those are the days that bind us together, forever
These little things define us, forever, forever

All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm going to find you and take it slowly

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm going to find you and make you want me

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die

Swing the ox when I rumble Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go ahead, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs

Haven't ever lost one minute of sleeping
Worried about the way things might have been

Been a lot of places down in Memphis
I umped a lot of babes down in New Orleans
Had a lot of shots at good times in the city
Till I hitched a ride on a river bout queen

A big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on a river
Rollin, rollin, rollin on a river

If you come down to the river
I betcha you're gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry
'Cause you have no money
People along the river are happy to give

I said a big wheel keeps on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin' on a river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on a river

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Hey, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
Well, mama's head has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye.
Not a single word was said,
No final kiss to seal any sins.
I had no idea of the state we were in.

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.

But don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember me once more.

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong.
The more I do, the less I know.

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.

But don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember me once more.

Gave you the space so you could breathe,
I kept my distance so you would be free,
And hoped that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me.

Why don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember you used to love me.

When will I see you again?

My dearest love who existed in a dream
Till this evening when a wave came and swept me out to sea
None of the loves that you have known
Could prepare you for the love raging everywhere in me
For all the arms that have covered you the hands
That have touched you and the lips
You have lingered on before
Added together would be less than an olive
In the banquet of love I have in store
Love season to entice
Love with all the trimmings filled with spice
Love flavored to your whim
Served piping hot with all the trimmings...Ooo...
For I'll decode every breath and every sigh
Till your every lover's wish
Is fulfilled before it's made
Toss in some jealousy and doubt
Should it be required
Not to rest till there's nothing more desired
Thus loving as I do
Never, never will you ever be untrue
Having love with all the trimmings
Waiting home for you...

At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
Who can handle such a heavy load

At the mercy
At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
We can think of nothing more to say

If you show me love
I won't refuse
I know you'd never make me choose
Between the love I've got
And the love I'd lose

Sometimes I'd rather run and hide
Than stay and face the fear inside

At the mercy
At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day
Who can bear to turn their head away

At the mercy
At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy road
We can watch the universe explode

If you take me up
I won't say no
I guess you'd rather see me grow
Into a better man than the one you know

Sometimes my head is hanging low
But it's time to get on with the show

At the mercy
At the mercy
At the mercy of a busy day

Falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone

May it follow you forever

May we stay lost on our way home

I am a man of many hats

I've never felt much smaller since the fall
Nobody seems to know my name
So don't leave me to sleep all alone
May we stay lost on our way home?

Gonna mail it to my local D.J.
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart beating rhythm
While my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I caught it off the writer
Sittin' down by the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven
We're rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just triffle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
A rocking in two by two - Ooo

Well early in the morning
I'm a giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see them reel an rock
Long as she's got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven

Take away, the scent of flowers
Cover up, the sky of blue
Close my ears to tender love songs
They remind me too much of you

Hide young lovers warm embraces
Keep stars and moonlight from my view
Let me forget, there are such places
They remind me too much of you

Must I evermore be haunted?
Day after day, my whole life through
By the memory of each moment
That I spent alone with you

If these lovely things dont hurt you
Our love just wasnt meant to be
But please come back to me, my darling
If they remind you, too much of me

Day  after  day
I  must  face  a  world  of  strangers
Where I don't belong
I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that
There's  someone  I  can  turn  to
Who will  always  care
You're  always  there
When  there's  no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest dream won't  come true
I can take all the madness
This world  has to give
But I won't last a day without you
So many times
When the city seems to be
Without  a  friendly  face
A lonely place
It's nice to know
That you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile
It's  all  worth  while
When  there's  no getting  over  that  rainbow
When  my  smallest dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness
This world  has to give
But I won't last a day without you
Love,  touch me
And I end up singing
Troubles seem to walk and disappear
Mmm...  you touch  me
With the love you're bringing
I can really loose
When you're near
When you're  near
My love if all my  friends
Have forgotten half their promises
They're  not  unkind
Just  hard  to  find
And one look at you
And I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I've found the best
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When  my  smallest  of  dreams
Won't  come  true
I can take all the madness
This world  has to give
But I won't last a day without you
No, I won't last a day without  you
I can't last a day without you...

Oh baby, oh baby, oh we both know the truth
If it were the real me and you,
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy, we're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you,
Yeah we got nothing to lose

It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so I give in to you

This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in our reattachment

Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms

Oh baby, oh baby, oh, we both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together, we don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast,
Maybe we should take it too far

Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now

I hold on to your whole body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
When the world outside's too
Much to take
That all ends when I'm with you

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me

We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away

'Cause I am your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me

2997,Bob Dylan,,Making A Liar Out Of Me (Rehearsal),,"

I tell people, you just going through changes
And that you're acquainted both with night and day
That your money's good and you just being courageous
On them burning bridges knowing your feet are made of clay
Well I say you won't be destroyed by your inventions
That you brought it all under captivity
And that you really do have all the best intentions
But you're making a liar out of me

Well I say that you just young and self-tormented
But that deep down you understand
The hopes and fears and dreams of the discontented
That threaten now to overtake your promised land
Well I say you'd not sow discord among brothers
Nor drain a man of his integrity
That you remember the cries of orphans and their mothers
But you're making a liar out of me
But you're making a liar out of me

Well I say that, that ain't flesh and blood you're drinking
In the wounded empire of your fool's paradise
With a light above your head forever blinking
Turning virgins into merchandise
That you must have been beautiful when you were living
You remind me of some old-time used-to-be
I say you can be trusted with the power you been given
But you're making a liar out of me

So many things so hard to say as you stumble
To take refuge in your offices of shame
As the earth beneath my feet begins to rumble
And your young men die for nothin', not even fame
I say that someday you'll begin to trust us
And that your conscience not been slain by conformity
That you stand up unafraid to believe in justice
But you're making a liar out of me
You're making a liar out of me

Well I can hear the sound of distant thunder
From an open window at the end of every hall
Now that you're gone I got to wonder
If you ever were here at all
I say you never sacrificed my children
To some false god of infidelity
And that it's not the Tower of Babel that you're building
But you're making a liar out of me
You're making a liar out of me
Well you're making a liar out of me

I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born

A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
Hee! Hee!

There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, ""Welcome to your doom""
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

This is Heartbreak Hotel

Before from our small island
Brought right back to these shores
To these shores, to these shores

Beneath the Durban Skies

The heaven’s opened, rain poured down
It poured down
Down, down

Grey and brown, the seventies
The suits you wore, and the ones you loved
Were so young, were so young,
God, you were so young

Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster

Through your dreaming wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero

Excitation
Are you remembering the sound?
Recall the shaking of the ground?

Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned

Straight
Light passes through
Penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter

Illumination
Bright
Bathe in the volume and light
Reanimated by fire

Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground

Pounding, pounding
No remorse

Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun

Come inside

And tell me, if I lie down
Would you stay now
And let me hold you?

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?

Strawberries taste how lips do

Diving in too soon

In the morning dew

How can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when I'm feeling sad

You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once, think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad, why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had

You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once, think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad, why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
How can you lose what you never had

A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end

In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?

In my trials
And my tribulations
Through our doubts
And frustrations

In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear
And my confessions

In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part

Did you see that man in the limousine
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

Did you see that man with a fat cigar
He just left his lovers with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
Where the rest of the street can peer

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)

But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy the lot, his friend

'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)

Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect

You hear stories of old
Of princes bold
With riches untold
Happy souls
Casting it all aside
To take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams
At their side
But not me
I couldn't do that
Not me
I'm not like that

I couldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love

I really like you
I'm attracted to you
The way you move
The things you do
I'll probably burn in hell
For saying this
But I'm really in heaven
Whenever we kiss
But Oh no!
You won't change me
You can try
For an eternity

I wouldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love

Now I've got things to do
You have too
And I've got to be me
You've got to be you
So take my hand
And feel these lips
And let's savour a kiss
Like we'd savour a sip
Of vintage wine
One more time
Let's surrender
To this love divine

But we won't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love

Need an intervention, someone to listen
Catholic or Christian, fuck your suspicions

Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me

When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools
And we don't understand
Oh, be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all, you're all
For all, for always

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

2549,Bob Dylan,1964.0,To Ramona,"""Another Side Of Bob Dylan""","

Ramona, come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise

The flowers of the city
Though breath-like, get deathlike sometimes
And there's no use in tryin'
To deal with the dyin'
Though I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements still capture the minutes I'm in

But it grieves my heart, love
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist
It's all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this

I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
Back to the South

You've been fooled into thinking
That the finishin' end is at hand
Yet there's no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

I've heard you say many times
That you're better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose

From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem
That hype you
And type you
And making you feel that you gotta be just like them

I'd forever talk to you
But soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring

Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday, maybe
Who knows, baby
I'll come and be cryin' to you

Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You-you collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—

Smash into everyone, crash into everything

Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Take a look at what I've done

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it
Shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measuring stick (what?), twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words, you get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Tearing our minds up and turning to stone
Break through the water, born to be wild
Run 'til your lungs burn and fill you with fire

Oh

Or if the ground falls out beneath

You dropped your love, now you're waiting on me
Let's take it over while we're still young
Never felt so alive

She was 19 with a baby on the way
On the East-side of the city, she was working every day
Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake
She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change
And, 'cross town she'd take the bus at night to a one bedroom apartment
And when she'd turn on the light
She would sit down at the table
Tell herself that it's alright
She was waiting on the day she hoped the baby would arrive
She'd never be alone
Have someone to hold
And when nights were cold, she'd say

The world's not perfect but it's not that bad
If we got each other and that's all we have
I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect
When the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

They were 90 and were living out their days on the west side of the city next to where they got engaged
They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they'd made
And though life was never easy they were thankful that they stayed
With each other and though sometimes were hard
Even when she made him angry he would never break her heart
No they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car
But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart
Even at the end, their love was stronger than the day that they first met
They'd say

The world's not perfect but it's not that bad
If we got each other and that's all we have
I will be your lover and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect
When the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your lover and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

You should know I'll be there for you

I'm 23 and my folks are getting old
I know they don't have forever and I'm scared to be alone
So I'm thankful for my sister even though sometimes we fight
When high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived
I know she'd never leave me
And I hate to see her cry
So I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side
I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side
I wrote this verse to tell her that

The world's not perfect but it's not that bad
If we got each other and that's all we have
I will be your brother and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you
When the world's not perfect
When the world's not kind
If we have each other then we'll both be fine
I will be your brother and I'll hold your hand
You should know I'll be there for you

You should know I'll be there for you

To feel you, it's so real with you
I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world               ú
Is turning  up-side-down
You'll always belong to me
(Comin' in and out of your life)
Isn't easy,
When there's so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you
I can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember...

Here we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time
We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing
We learned is how to hurt each other
I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away
Yeah-yeah, yeah!

I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

So save your voice, don't waste your breath
Can't you see we're at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget (hmm)
And all the fights and all the ways
We almost made it but we never did
And it's finally come to this

A little bird, he told me so
He said come on, get on the go
Open your eyes the sky is full of butterflies
The blossoms on the trees stir up the honey bees
Spring makes my fever right

Spring fever, Spring is here at last
Spring fever, my heart's beating fast
Get up, get out spring is everywhere

Well if you feel the wanderlust
Just grab a car or hop a bus
In every town there's excitement to be found
So much is happening
Don't miss the joy of spring
The world's in love just look around

Spring fever comes to everyone
Spring fever, it's time for fun
Get up, get out spring is everywhere

Spring fever, it's Spring fever time
Spring fever, watch that fever climb
Get up, get out spring is everywhere

Blue eyes crying in the rain

Only memories remain
Through the ages I remember

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting

Well the pressure's down, the boss ain't here
He gone North, for a while    
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, that's a cute hat
And that smile's so hard to resist
But what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?

You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
It's done with a flick of the wrist
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?

You know, a woman like you should be at home 
That's where you belong
Taking care for somebody nice             
Who don't know how to do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take ?
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?

You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.

You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before ya came in the door
They say in your father's house, there's many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
There's only one step down from here, baby
It's called the land of permanent bliss
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this ?

Watch where you walk 'cause the sidewalks talk
And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it everyone will know

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

[Chorus:]

Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak 'cause you gotta 'long the street
They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been mislead by the things you've said

When you're living on the street
Life can be full of misery
Find a place to call your own
Make your heart into a home

You can do it, uh huh

You can do it

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold

You better think twice when you cross the ice
Everything you do comes back to you
When you're shedding a tear sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

Soon as I figure out my right from my left
Don't make me smoke from the golden cigar
Don't make me go and wait in the car
I thought the party started quarter to nine
Soon after found out that I'd ruined the surprise
They all just stood there laughing loud as can be
Like sugar canes my face was melting

To molasses
To molasses
You can call
To molasses

Sometimes I wanna trade this brain for a new
And picking memories along with the view
Please don't mistake this for a hell of a time
Hold back my tears, so I don't spoil your wine

Felt like an idiot for ruining the night
They all stood stinking from the salt in their sea
Like sugar canes my face was melting

Tearin' up the radio lost in the stereo sound

She's trouble in a tank top pretty little time bomb
Blowing up I'll take you down
Living in the radio lost in the stereo sound

She's dancing alone, I'm ready to go but she's so

Sit back gotta catch my breath
'Cause every time I see her I know she's gonna take it back somehow

Snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day

And I hear them say

Hey you've got to hide your love away
Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in

How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here

You will die when I say, you must die

Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow

Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

You were meant, just meant for me

On the first time that I saw you
How I fell for your cuddly charms
Lover doll I'm crazy for you
Let me rock you in my arms

I'm so glad I found you
Never thought dollies came full grown
I'm gonna tie a ribbon around you
Wrap you up and take you home

I would never treat you badly

Even though I know that you don't live there now
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I can't stop myself on drivin' by your house

Ooh, every time I hear a song it kind of hurts me still
And ooh, even after all this time I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
Cause we'll never be kids again
No we'll never be kids again

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Can't think of nothing but you
You are the reason I wake up in the morning
Lately, I'm sleeping 'til 2
Sometimes I swear that you're lying here beside me
I reach for you girl and you're not there
Still got the smell of your body on the pillow
Still finding strings of your hair
Tell me, can we try, baby?

Can we get back to love again?
Seems like I'm losing my best friend
Can you rescue me from the rain
And be my sunshine again?
Can I make it up to you?
I promise that I'll do anything for us
'Cause baby I love you
I mean it, I need you
Let's go back to love again

I don't wanna go on without you, baby
Don't wanna hurt anymore

Ain't nothing left to live for
And I try but I can't stop loving you

Give me one more night to change your mind
And girl, I swear
Tonight will be the night I'm gonna take you there

Always to have you near

At first I thought that I was dreamin'
But then I heard the voice of a girl and it sounded like she'd been cryin'
Now I'm too worried to be sleepin'

So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked up on her door
She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing

She said, ""I think your ears are playing tricks on you""
Sweater zipped up to her chin
""Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing""
She said, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""
She said, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""

No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
I didn't want to intrude because I knew that I didn't have all the facts
But I couldn't bear the thought of leavin' her

Walked down the hall and then I knocked up on her door

Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""

Aim my boom box at the roof, I'm playing ""Lean On Me""
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I hope she knows she'll be okay
Aim my boom box at the roof, I'm playing ""Lean On Me""
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I know exactly what I'll say

Promise I'm not playing tricks on you
You're always welcome to come in
You could stay here for an hour or two
If you ever need a friend
We can talk about the noise, when you're ready, but till then
I'll say, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind

Bout a quarter after three.

And I ain't complainin' none
If the clouds don't drop and the train

Goin' down to see some girl
Goin' to have some fun.

Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I just say no thanks
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks.
Well, sometime you know when the well 
breaks down
I just go on pump it some.
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just sit there waitin' for me to come.

It's these substandard motels on the (la, la, la, la, la) corner of 4th and Fremont Street.
Appealing only 'cause they are just that un-appealing
Any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering.
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe just a dash of formaldehyde,
And the habit of decomposing right before your very (la, la, la, la) eyes.

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Tonight tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday.
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money.
Oh, wonderful caricature of intimacy.

Yeah, yeah.

And not to mention the constable and his proposition, for that ""virgin""
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on ""strictly business""
As he said to the Mrs.
Well, only hours before,
After he had left, she was fixing her face in a compact.
There was a terrible crash
There was a terrible crash between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag,
And held a ""purse"" of a different kind.

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

There are no raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses.
It's sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
At the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things.

[Haunted Voice:]
I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

[Michael Jackson:]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere

(Aaaahhh!)

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is this scary for you, baby
Is this scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is this scary for you, baby

[*Whispering and breathing*]
{Sorcery... Illusions...}

There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night

But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me

[*Reporter speaking*]

All hail, the king has risen

You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie, not the first time
Now my morning has broken, and it brings the fear
My mind's falling, falling

Then I feel my pulse quickening
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah, I feel my pulse quickening
When your name lights up the screen

Oh Joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

How'd you always know when I'm down?
How'd you always know when I'm down?

Take a walk through the wreckage, clearing out my head
I hear your eyes roll right down the phone
I'm your walking disaster, keep on dragging me
From self-pity, poor me

Then I feel my pulse quickening
But I wouldn't change a thing

Oh Joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

How'd you always know when I'm down?

As the night dissolves into this final frame
You're a sweet relief, you saved me from my brain
From my brain, from my brain, from my brain
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh Joy, when you called me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in

Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somehow you'll see her again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you hear her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go

The beautiful days are long gone
I can’t seem to breathe
It feels like it hasn’t been that long
Since you walked away from me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know I still think of you that way
You should know…that

The beautiful lights the star filled nights
They don’t mean a thing
Cause you were my star and so it don’t seem right
Without you here with me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know its hard for me to say
You were my soul…

Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn’t be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain 

Now when your in love it takes time to heal
When someone’s broken your heart it changes how you feel
Girl I thought that you’d never do me that way
But even after all I still think of you that way

Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
(I could say this and I could say that)
And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn’t be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain

Now love is a game that we both like to play
But will I win or lose if I go or if I stay
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl you know me inside out and I can’t get you off my mind

Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn’t be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain

Well I used to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballroom dancing

Well I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing

Well it went so fast and we all grew up
Now the days that passed in the china cup
Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four

Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV

I let down my guard...
Swore I'd never fall in love again
But I fell hard.

Guess I should have seen it coming,
Caught me by surprise...
I wasn't looking where I was going,
I fell into your eyes.

You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing wave.
Before I, I knew what hit me baby you were flowing through my veins...

I'm addicted to you,
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Out of control,
What can I do?
I'm addicted to you!

Midnight blows in through the window,
Dances round the room...
Got me hypnotized,
I'm getting high on the perfume.

I couldn't live without you now,
Oh, I know I'd go insane,
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist, so
I walked down, towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care, take my hand, I'll take you there

Wooo!

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (Without, no name)

As she took me right through the fog
I seen beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She said this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and they started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend

Hooo!

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, take me, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without)

Hooo!
Yeah!
Doggone!
Hooo!

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought, you could be in another world

Oooh!

Take me to a place without no name (Doggone, take me, no name)
Take me to a place without no name (See, a place without no name)

And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

[Chorus - Eminem]

Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can fear me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us

Yeah, Trick Trick

It's goin' down baby
Ayo Em, I got you back my nigga
Damn right I said my nigga

Kissed and closed my eyes

Almost love, but never quite
Never seemed exactly right
Just another love affair
Then I turned and you were there
You smiled and the world never was the same
I was in love before I even knew your name
Instantly I knew
All my life has led to you
And though the child in me was dazzled by your charms
A women was awakened in your arms
Who dreamed I could feel all the things I do

I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

Hello, hello
Nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you, how can I forget

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark
I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

3012,Bob Dylan,,The Shape I'm In,,"

Go out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Has anybody seen my lady
This living alone will drive me crazy
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I'm gonna go down by the water
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no
I'll just be looking for my maker
And I hear that that's where she's been? Oh!

Out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I just spent 60 days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you trying to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Why can't you just tell me the truth?
Hard to believe the things you say
Why can't you feel the tears I cried today
Cried today, cried today

How do you win if we all lose?
You change the facts to justify
Your lips move but your words get in the way
In the way, in the way

Kings and Queens, crooks and thieves
You don't see the forest for the trees
Head and heart, on our knees
You can't see what we all see

How do you sleep when the world keeps turning?
All that we built has come undone
How do you sleep when the world is burning?

Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, you lie to me

You can build castles in the sky
You can use smoke and mirrors, all clichés

Oh, my man, I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair, but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, all right...
What's the difference if I say I'll go away
When I know I'll come back on my knee someday
For whatever my man is, I am his forever more
It cost me a lot,
But there's one thing that I've got, it's my man
Cold and wet tired, you bet,
But all that I soon forget with my man
He's not much for looks
And no hero out of books is my man
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me, but I love him...
Oh, my man, I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair, but I don't care

All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see

What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about

I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last

Go with it, go with it, HOO!

You made me to a walkin' wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck

Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up
After all my liquor's been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been thunk
Well, after I do some of these things
I'm gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
[*Scratches*] My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational [*scratch*] ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it.""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ah!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)
[*scratch*] Guess who's back
[*scratch*] Gue— [*scratch*] guess who's back
D-12 [*scratch*] guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre [*scratch*] guess who's back

I used to walk with you
Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know
Would always smile ""Hello""
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you

And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you

This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone
Why is the pain much worse?

Look so much better without make-up
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up
Realize I've made a big mistake

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast. I know you're there
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old

And now you stand up from the table
And say you never look back
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight
My heart beats fast, I know you're there
I pretend like I don't care
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you
It hurts so much to know the truth
But I'm still in love with you

No more kisses on your lips and tender touches, please
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And all the cuts you gave me open up and start to bleed
And I just can't get over you until you're over me

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight

3019,Bob Dylan,,Up To Me,,"

Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept followin', trackin' us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me

If I'd thought about it I never would've done it, I guess I would've let it slide
If I'd lived my life by what others were thinkin', the heart inside me would've died
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the risin' star, I guess it was up to me

Oh, the Union Central is pullin' out and the orchids are in bloom
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it must be up to me

It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
I'd just about convinced myself that nothin' had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me

Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club
I would've followed you in the door but I didn't have a ticket stub
So I waited all night 'til the break of day, hopin' one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me

Oh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me

Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat
She's everything I need and love but I can't be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be
But she ain't a-gonna make me move, I guess it must be up to me

We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me

Well, Dupree came in pimpin' tonight to the Thunderbird Café
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Well, I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company
But you ain't a-gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me

There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
She's the one you been wond'rin' about, but there's really nothin' much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me

So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me

And if we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you know it was up to me

So put away your fears

Millions of stars placed in the skys
By One God
Millions of us lift up our eyes
To One God
So many children calling to him
By many a diffrent name
One father
Loving each the same
Many the ways all of us pray
To one god
Many the path
Winding their way
To One God
Brothers and sisters there are no strangers
After his work is done
For your God and my God
Are one
So many children calling outloud
By many a different name
One father

Many the ways all of us pray

Many the paths winding their way

There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth
Gotta be a reason for the dust and the dirt
The changing of the seasons never changed my hurt
So what's it worth, what's it worth
Worth another shot of whiskey and another sip of gin
Another drop of poison that is slowly sinkin' in
If we're going down together better take another hit
We won't be here forever so let's make the best of it

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Walking down to the burial ground with a sad song in his brain
General Cloud is an old man now but it feels like yesterday
He was on the front lines, stranded on the beach
Crawling to his best friend, floatin' in the sea
But he didn't make it, he still can't believe
How arbitrary fate is, he says...

There's gotta be a reason that I'm here on Earth

She went down to her job in town with a sad song in her heart
33 with a wasted dream to become a movie star
Living outta suitcase, serving at a bar
Saving up some pennies working after dark
Is she gonna make it, she still can't believe
How arbitrary fate is, she says...

When it's over, really over,
There ain't nothin' can start it over again.
Pack your bags and leave, ain't no use to grieve.
Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend.

The partings easier when there are smiles instead of tears.
In your dreams you see that moment even if you live a million years.
Shake hands goodbye then, for remember when;
Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend.

Let him go home, and cry your eyes out,
You'll only feel a little better.
Try to keep your body busy and let your mind forget him.

'Cause when it's over, really over,
There ain't nothin' can start it over again.
Shake hands goodbye then, for remember when;
Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend.

Though you leave behind a lover,
Leave behind a friend.

Try to win a friend.

Dropping glasses just to hear them break

Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it but I promise we're not mean

They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)

No-one round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises: we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, 
""Secretly you love this do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

We shared our first embrace

Our cottage was small
But richer than all
The palaces of the king
All day the birds would sing
Our hearts were filled with spring

What happened to our love so cruel?
Padre, oh padre

Then he came along
And sang her his song
And won her with honey lies
He of the fiery eyes
Now it's not her that cries

So I will pray

And weary my heart has grown
Wondering where love has flown
Counting my beads alone

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself, I'm here again
All by myself, you know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

Like ""I"" before ""E"" except after ""C""
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you
(Teach you, teach you)
All about love, girl
(All about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

A B C
Easy as, 1 2 3
As simple as, do re mi
A B C, 1 2 3
Baby, you and me, girl
A B C
It's easy, it's like counting up to 3
1 2 3
Sing a simple melody
Do re mi, ABC
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody (That's how easy can be)
1 2 3, you and me

Hi-ya!
Sit down girl
I think I love ya
And all I want you to do is repeat after me
Say 'ABC' (ABC)
Say 1 2 3 (1 2 3)
ABC (ABC)
Say 1 2 3 (1 2 3)

Shake it, shake it baby, come on now
Shake it, shake it baby, ooh, ooh
Shake it, shake it baby, ho
1 2 3 baby, ooh ooh
A B C baby, nah nah
Do re mi, baby, oh
That's how easy love can be

A B C it's easy
It's like counting up to 3
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be

[Jackson 5:]
Stop! Nanana! You'd better save it!
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!
Woo!

[Michael Jackson:]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop the love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Jackson 5:]
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

S is for ""Save it""
T is for ""Take it slow""
O is for ""Oh, no""
P is for ""Please, please, don't go! ""

This is a Christmas Lullaby
To steal softly into dreaming
A simple Christmas lullaby
I sing to you each passing year
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder in silent mystery
And in this spell that we are under
Blessing surround our hearts completely
This is a Christmas Lullaby
For someone lovely as snow falling
I sing your Christmas Lullaby
To cradle you with all our love
Let peace on earth be yours tonight
Under the star that shines so bright
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder
In Silent mystery
And in this spell that we are under
Blessing surround our hearts completely
Now close your eyes and as you sigh
Make up a Christmas wish to dream on
And like the moon that shines on high
Send out your wish to that star in the sky
Blessed by this Christmas lullaby.........!

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I'm leaving bitterness
Behind this time
I'm cleaning out my mind
There is no space
For the regrets
I will remember to forget

Just look at me
I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies
At which I vibrate
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I'm leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows
That it cast
There is a radar in my heart
I should have trusted
From the start

Just look at me
I'm a living act of holiness
Giving all the positivity
That I possess
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It's meant to be
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It's an inevitability

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people living life in peace

With skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colors of a rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of the people strolling by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
I think they're really saying, I love you

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Oh, I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They will learn much more
Than I'll never know
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think it could be
Such a wonderful world

Imagine
Oh, imagine
Oh, just imagine

There is a city of gold
Far from this rat-race, eats at your soul
Far from the confusion and the bars that hold
There is a city of gold

There is a country of light
Raised up in glory, angels wear white
Never know darkness, never know night
There is a country of light

There is a city of love
Far from this world, stuff dreams are made of
Fear of no darkness, beyond the stars above
There is a city of love

There is a city of hope
Don't need no doctor, don't need no dope
I'm ready and willing, throw down a rope
There is a city of hope

There is a city of gold
Far from this rat race that tears at your soul
Far from the confusion and the bars that hold
There is a city of gold
There is a city of gold

Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
""Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help""

If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from

Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

Is anybody out there?

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man

I'm no longer scared to have it cut
Oh, oh, oh, back in the gym where I start to sweat
Um, maybe not yet
Say, ""Hi"" on the street
Air kiss on the cheek
It's been so long since I've put on my shoes
So, oh, oh, let's hit the club
Or get drunk and get matching tattoos

No lockdowns anymore
Time to go back to work indoors
No more sweatpants or Zooming in
While I really watch Bridgerton
No lockdowns anymore
Traffic is so much worse than before
The world's such a new place to me
What's an NFT? I have no idea. What?

So, oh, oh, been a long wait
I'm so ready for life to re-start
(No lockdowns, no lockdowns)
(Ready for life to re-start)
No lockdowns anymore
Gonna live the next year outdoors
We could see a movie at three
Making plans is like sex to me

To embrace all that life has in store
It's time to make new memories

Hug your family (It's time to hug your family)

Tell me all your original sins

Man, this echo chamber's getting loud

I came here for sanctuary,
Away from the winds and the sounds of the city.
I came here to get some peace,
Way down deep where the shadows are heavy.

I can't help but think of you.
In these four walls my thoughts seem to wander
To some distant century
When everyone we know is six feet under.

When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me
For all to see.

When our lives are over
And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones,
Let's take it to the grave.

And hold me in your arms,
Hold me in your arms,
I'll be buried here with you.
And I'll hold in these hands all that remains.

I don't want to rest in peace,
We can haunt each others' dreams.
We'll fight underneath this turf
And bicker away in darkness.

We'll find a way to resolve
Our banes from the land of the living.
We'll find a common ground
And fall in love all over again.

When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me
For all, all to see.

When our lives are over
And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones,
Let's take it to the grave.

And hold me in your arms,
Hold me in your arms,
I'll be buried here with you.
And I'll hold in these hands all that remains.

From dusk to dawn
My unheard screams grow silent in defeat.
I know I chased a memory,
But you used to taste so sweet.

As you fade away I realise it's all over
And nothing stays the same
But skull and bones, and pain.

When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me
For all, all to see.

When our lives are over
And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones,
Let's take it to the grave.

Hold me in your arms,
Hold me in your arms,
I'll be buried here with you.
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains.

Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

Switched it up, then everybody
Done changed the shit on that damn

Yeah, I was young, I was hungry
I was chasin' the bag at twenty-one, I was lucky
To find an uneaten fucking (What?) honeybun I forgot about
Now I got money falling out, fifties, hundreds, and twenties (Twenties)
And I know nothing is funny 'bout the Manchester bombing
But we got something in common (What?), both of us are alarming
Foul, disgusting, and awful (Yeah), so repugnant and ugly (Yup)
I could give the Boston Marathon a run for its money, yeah
And you could say I'm a little bit immature
But this type of literature got me a little richer
But I get insecure when them other dudes hit on you, girl
You're letting 'em fiddle with your clitoris
Remember you were my fucking...

You used to be my favorite bitch
Things'll never be the same, ain't it funny how you changed
Up and flipped the script?
You done let a bunch of lames fall through and complain
That I can't permit
You ain't have to do it like that, told you I'll be right back
Look what you did, I need a new chick
Like the music, I had to bounce on my favorite bitch

Always hated my smile
Mama told me it's goofy
I'd get picked on at school
Come home and she'd school me
She never sugarcoated it to me
She said if I wasn't so stupid and ugly, I wouldn't always get bullied (True)
I think of my struggles (Yeah) and get emotional
Could be 'cause how behind the eight-ball and far in the hole that they put me
Now I'm on a roll like a Tootsie (Yeah)
I'm just trollin' you pussies
But I'm like a stroller 'cause you'll see just how I roll if you push me
But that's what I do this music for
When I was goin' through some of the hardest times, I drew from her
But she's like the devil 'cause I just can't let loose of her
Plus the thought of losin' her makes me wanna just let loose on her
Then I hit the studio, tryna rendezvous with her
Tell her, ""It's a butt-dial girl,"" yeah, booty call (Haha)
That's how it used to be, 'cause you and me, we ruled the world
And we made Curtis blow (Fifty)
Fuck, I miss them days

You used to be my favorite bitch

I'ma put one in the back of your fuckin' head

Would you marry me again?
Now that everything is changed (Yeah)
It'll never be the same (Nah)
As the era whence we came (Who?)
From Nas to Pac, Rak' (Yeah), Eric B. and Kane (I know)
But I know a few from this era that are lyrically insane
And although most are never gonna hit the level Cole or Weezy at
Or be emotionally attached to Yo! MTV Raps (Yeah)
Runnin' home from school to catch an episode
The feeling that it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape
You hold and peel it back, yeah
Tear it off, then play it (What?)
I swear to God, four o'clock
We'd crowd around the TV, Butter in his underwear and socks
When Nani was Kon Artis (Yeah) and Proof had his hair in locs (Doody)
Yeah, back when Flavor Flav had us wearing clocks
(Back when) Back when Ed Lover (Yeah)
When there was two Dr. Dre's, that's a paradox (Pair of Docs)
But I never thought I'd get so jealous
At the thought of letting you go psychologically
It's gonna bother me, my eyes are already watery
Part of me don't wanna stop (Yeah) 'til I get you back
'Cause I gotta put the work in and tell you I'm never givin' this up
Other part wants to tell you just to get fucked
Go back to whatever dick that you sucked (Ah)
Get back together with them, you slut
Givin' up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist
When I helped you become bigger than you were
But I guess that it slipped your mind, you must be biding your time
Looking for someone to come along that'll make you feel like I did back when you were mine, huh? (Damn)
But truthfully, it was never really you and me exclusively
And there's too many new MC's you can choose between
But no matter how many motherfuckers ran through
Bet they can't do it like me
But I can't keep burnin' the candle at both ends
And I can't handle it when I leave and you find another one
Now I gotta take this beat and dismantle it
I won't grieve when I kill you
But if I can't have you, bitch, nobody can
Hear me? I used to be your favorite, bitch

'Twas in another lifetime one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

And if I pass this way again you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us something there's been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

Well I'm living in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said
""I'll give you shelter from the storm""

I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue

Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw

From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose
It's not as sweet as the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flue

Sweet seducing sighs

He tells me it's my fault he's late
Now I clean up the kitchen till noontime
And then I vacuum till a quarter to three

At seven he calls up and says ""don't cook supper""

Throw away my time

We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just
Did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you
And love is ""evol""
Spell it backwards I'll show you

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfucking ho's
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like trying to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on 'til you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold you, I wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breath away
You're a supernova... and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same?
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
'Fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be making a mistake
Cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezing
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would have did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a...

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you

[Verse 1 - Skylar Grey:]
You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach
A wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a

[Pre-Hook - Eminem:]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

[Hook - Skylar Grey:]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
The worst of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around her throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a... (shit)
(She don't give a shit)

[Verse 2 - Skylar Grey & Eminem:]
Sometimes I wish that you'd just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good
All you are to me

[Verse 3 - Yelawolf:]
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married?
Well Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside

Maybe I'm the twisted one that screwed this up
So I guess this means Goodbye, for now

""You're so free,"" that's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around, refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I had come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong

I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody told me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall

Can't complain, I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, is it safe?

I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown

""Look this way, just a little smile,"" is what they say
""You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay""

Why did we ever start?

Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell

When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view

There was nothing that she wouldn't do

Deep down inside

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm

She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played Lord with a feel
Some call it folk, some call it soul
But people let me tell you it was rock and roll

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Listening to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
A honky tonk a Hound Dog, a Johnny B. Goode
Chain Gang, Love Is Strange, Knock On Wood

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll

I thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation knew it would last
Time's gone by, the beat goes on
But every time I hear it Lord it takes me home

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
Every day when I got home I turned on my radio

Mother played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Mozart's sonatas down the classical Liszt
My papa loved to listen to those country songs
While I was in the back room rockin' on

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll

I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat, I was made for rock and roll
I was raised on rock, I got rhythm in my soul

I'll go my way by myself
It's how the comedy ends
I'll have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friend
I'll try to apply myself

You used to be my confidante
My underneath the staircase friend
But I fell out of love with you
And brought our romance to an end

I played with you throughout the day
And told you every secret thought
Unlike my other so-called friends
You stood beside me as I fought

In your reflected glory I
Could dream of shining far off lands
Where serpents turn to bits of string
And played like kittens in my hand

In our imaginary world
Where butterflies wear army boots
And stomp around the forest chanting
Long lost anthems

So I give her the benefit of the doubt I

Hope it ain't ""here we go, yo"" 'cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though, should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First ""No [*slurp*], you don't [*slurp*] under—[*slurp*]—stand [*slurp*]. I [*slurp*] don't [*hic*] do [*slurp*] this for anyone ever.""
Yeah, that ain't what they all say

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me, like she never did before
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
I told that bitch

I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water he drowned, like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya'

And, Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those

Now have a blessed day..."" Bitch, you serious?

You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im

That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous
As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle

And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care

So needless to say, I'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off 'Wee-Bey' from the Wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ, each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display, is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-Day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes, that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin' 73 thank
God there's an exit comin' up, what the mother F-U-C-K's
Wrong with her, hit the off-ramp, 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt, hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me, OK, you wanna fuck with me 'eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
And created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved (the fuck?)
Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray, durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict I guess
That's why I'm so clingy every girl I've ever had either says
I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin' dramatic, man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just
A fuckin' romantic, I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road,"" and after she left I sent that bitch a text
I said, ""Be careful driving. Don't read this and have an accident!"" She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect- no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case, than the model covered in L'Oréal and Mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories, for story telling, while the whore was yelling rape
'Til her vocal cords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates
Of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of
[*Phone ring*] wait, ""Dinner at eight?""
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of love

Born in Red Hook Brooklyn in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way ""Well"" he answered ""just because"".

Larry was the oldest Joey was next to last
They called Joe ""Crazy"" the baby they called ""Kid Blast""
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.

Joey, Joey
King of the streets child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away.

There was talk they killed their rivals but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge thinking he was bulletproof.

The war broke out at the break of dawn it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement called them amateurs.

The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
""Let's blow this place to kingdom come let Con Edison take the blame""
But Joey stepped up, and he raised his hand and said, ""We're not those kind of men
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again"".

Joey, Joey
King of the streets child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away.

The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
""What time is it"" said the judge to Joey when they met
""Five to ten"" said Joey. The judge says, ""That's exactly what you get"".

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.

When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, ""I've returned and now I want what's mine"".

Joey, Joey
King of the streets child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away.

It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
""I'm around too many children"", he'd say, ""they should never know of one""
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out his register, said, ""Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe"".

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it coming through the doors as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.

Joey, Joey
King of the streets child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away.

Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, ""He ain't dead he's just asleep""
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of the Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God's in heaven overlooking his preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.

Joey, Joey

4329,Elvis Presley,1976.0,The Last Farewell,"""From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee""","

There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow forOld England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales

And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see that foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell

I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee

And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the Dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

The only thing that's worse than emptiness
Is when your heart's lost
And the only thing that's worth the pain
Is the price of what love costs
Just when you think it's all in your hands
That's when it's gone
And you're thinking you're invincible
Believe me, you're so wrong
Tell me how does it feel

How does it feel to be a fallen angel?
Your wings are lying on the ground (on the ground)
How does it feel to be a fallen angel? (fallen angel)
Forever is a long way down

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life’s an open book
Don’t close it ’fore it’s done
The brightest flame burns quickest
That’s what I heard her say
A son’s heart’s owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

“Rebel,” my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I’m coming home
I’m not all you wished of me
A mother’s love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone’s all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Doctor, doctor, tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty
Another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

From the Liverpool docks to the red light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the Quarrymen.
Playing to the big crowds
Playing to the cheap seats
Another day in your life on your way to your journey’s end

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

Sailing through the trade winds bound for the sun
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn’t no way out of that deep dark cave

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

I heard the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city’s gone dark
There is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut it to the core

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

Put on your bags and get ‘em packed
Leave right now you won’t be far from wrong
The sooner you go, the quicker you’ll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

Slow down you’re moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary you’re about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

Roll on John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the right hand road and go where the buffalo roam
They’ll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

Tiger, Tiger burning bright
I pray the lord my soul to keep
In the forest of the night
Cover him over and let him sleep

Shine your light,
Move it on,
You burned so bright,
Roll on John

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
No emotions

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
No emotions

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

Step into the unknown and find yourself
You're floating freely, no emotion

Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue that's how, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only one left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
No emotions

Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in a trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off

Look out, kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
A man in a coon-skin cap
In a pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten.

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the DA

Look out, kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't tie no bows
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows.

Ah, get sick, get well
Hang around an ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail

Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool is
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters.

Ah, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift

Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles.

I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine

I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before

Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

I love you, please say
You love me too
Please say you love me too
Till the end of time
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together

Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time

Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes

Thinking that's gon' keep her happy
When time is all she wanted all along

Steady chasing your fame and your fortune

But all she wanna spend is time alone (Tonight)
Keep giving her (The finer things, but)
But she don't really need that (If you don't stop, you're)
You're gonna end up alone (Alone)

Give her what she needs
Do the simple things
Before you lose your girl to me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
Play on, player
Yeah, your girl coming with me shorty, ha ha
I'm telling you, man

Oh hoo oh hooo
Don't be a fool, you got a good thing
Man, are you blind, stupid or crazy?
You got a good thing, uh

If that's your lady, you better hold on
And give her what she want before she move on
Man, I tell you, cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing
If you ain't kicking it, baby

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said

When did lust for you become an organized crime?

Did you mean it? Could you feel it when you broke into my head?

Was it worth it? Was it perfect when you up and left me cynical?
Like you planned it, you're a bandit.
Just a no good, two-bit, filthy, rotten criminal.

Right from your silver plate, we checked in, checked out, checkmate

2965,Bob Dylan,,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,,"

I was sittin' on a stump
Down in New Orleans
I was feelin' kinda low down
Dirty and mean
Along came a fella
And he didn't even ask
He says, ""I know of a woman
That can fix you up fast""
I didn't think twice
I said like I should
""Let's go find this lady
That can do me some good""
We walked across the river
On a sailin' spree
And we came to a door
Called one-oh-three

I was just about ready
To give it a little knock
When out comes a fella
Who couldn't even walk
He's linkin' and a-slinkin'
Couldn't stand on his feet
And he moaned and he groaned
And he shuffled down the street
Well, out of the door
There comes another man
He wiggled and he wobbled
He couldn't hardly stand
He had this frightened
Look in his eyes
Like he just fought a bear
He was ready to die

Well, I peeked through the key crack
Comin' down the hall
Was a long-legged man
Who couldn't hardly crawl
He muttered and he uttered
In broken French
And he looked like he'd been through
A monkey wrench

Well, by this time
I was a-scared to knock
I was a-scared to move
I's in a state of shock
I hummed a little tune
And I shuffled my feet
And I started walkin' backwards
Down that broad street
Well, I got to the corner
I tried my best to smile
I turned around the corner
And I ran a bloody mile
Man, I wasn't runnin'
'Cause I was sick
I was just a-runnin'
To get out of there quick

Well, I tripped right along
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest
I musta run a mile
In a minute or less
I walked on a log
And I tripped on a stump
I caught a fast freight
With a one-arm jump
So, if you're travelin' down
Louisiana way
And you feel kinda lonesome
And you need a place to stay
Man, you're better off
In your misery
Than to tackle that lady
At one-oh-three

Luck loves me not tonight, I'm running out...
This four leaf clover's all but useless now.
I've got four wheels that say I'm not alone tonight,
I'm always looking for a joy ride through the
Brightest part of this town.

Break out, break out,
As we escape through the windows,
Head for the car, and never look back, singing-singing,
""Break out, break out,
Our time has come and we've got these big city dreams.""

Put up or shut up, we're not wasting time again,
The credits are rolling and we're getting lost again,
In parking lots, to serenading sirens,
As the blue lights bathed our smiles...

Break out, break out,
As we escape through the windows,
Head for the car, and never look back, singing-singing,
""Break out, break out,
Our time has come and we've got these big city dreams.""

Lets take a moment to reflect,
On the past few years of my life,
I haven't worked myself away,
To stay inside.
This is the time to let us...

Break out, break out,
As we escape through the windows,
Head for the car, and never look back, singing-singing,
""Break out, break out,

To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It's human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive alone
With no one left to love

There's no culture left
To love and cherish
It's gone, you know it's gone for good
A trillion memories
Lost in space and time for ever more
I just wanted
I just needed to be loved

Shame on you for loving me.

[Verse 1]
This is the ultimate journey of your life 
Where the weak die and the strong survive 
Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights 
Strap on your boots because you got a long hike 

[Chorus]
Just another journey, another journey into time 
C'mon now 
Just another journey, who ever thought I'd cross this line 
Ohohohohoh 

[Verse 2]

Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey (Jersey) 
A dollar to my name searchin for that key 
I'm tryin not to reincorinate my past 
I'm tired from the game, took another path 
Destination 95 Dirty South 
Where the devil tried to realter my route 
Creator took me by the hand and led the way-ay 
to make the story short thats why I'm here today 

[Chorus]

What about that day you said I wouldn't amount to shit
And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks 
What about that time you said I wouldnt make a dime 
And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine 
Destination to the bank overseas 
Where Akons treated like royalty 
Cause there's so much in this world i have to see-e 
The wagon's rolling so jump in a follow me-e

Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene

The best way to get to you is by this music thing 
And you might believe

Lets take it to the streets

Lets take it to the streets
I traveled through the ghettos all over

I was there in the rain,
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same

Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you,
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
Hey, who knows who your with
When I'm not there so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to stay and
When I'm gone

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere so
Bring on the party
I'm gonna have fun
Maybe meet someone
And when I get home
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess that you thought
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you,
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy

Hey, who knows who your with

Get out of this place and

Bring on the party
I'm gonna have fun
Maybe meet someone
And when I get home
You know you better be gone
You better be gone

So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
Hey, who knows who your with
When I'm not there so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way

You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home (home, home)
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down the walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home (home, home)
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It's not too late, it's not too late

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
There wasn't much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette
Feeling half dead, whisky on my mind
Then came the dead
Sherrif in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye
Baby in her arms
She took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave
Nonchalant about it
Maybe she'll come back
This time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don't
Wanted to change
But somehow I knew I really won't
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand
God's not going to land another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road, pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention
In fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away
And he started singing...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I didn't see it coming
I didn't see the wall
And I went from running, to a slow crawl
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door
Knock knock
I'm on the salt road non stop
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot
And the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap
I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge
But I can't forget the sound

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

[Verse 3/Outro: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down
[x4]

And we'll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again

I'll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can't be found
Only my God can track me down

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes, if the rain comes

And sip their lemonade

When the sun shines, when the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you that when it starts to rain

Everything's the same

Rain, I don't mind

This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away
Blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave
And watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You'll disappear one day

And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home

We had the greatest time at Frank Sinatra's party
We drank expensive wine then watched the night roll by
I saw a showgirl dance with Sammy Davis Jr
They had a brief romance under the desert sky

Fee-fi-fo-fum
I'm not the only Englishman
I'm undercover, but plenty of others
Are already flying high

See Angie Dickinson bump into Peter Lawford
She's out to have some fun, he doesn't seem to mind
You don't have to doubt yourself
No, not on a night like this

Jump in the swimming pool, say hi to Dino Martin
He's hot to play it cool, watching the girls go by

Fee-fi-fo-fum
I'm not the only Englishman
I'm undercover, but some of my brothers
Are already flying high

Come and enjoy yourself at Frank Sinatra's party
We had the greatest time watching the night go by

Surf's up
School's out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout

I've been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You gotta follow that dream
To a perfect world

I've been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I wanna ride with you

This ride still runs
Wanna ride with you

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Gotta take it by the horns
Gotta seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream

Follow that dream
Follow that dream

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up

Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up - School's out

Follow that dream
Follow that dream

There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes

Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it

There'll be days
When I stray
I may appear to be
Constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say
I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain will you return it
I'll say it again - pain
Pain will you return it
I won't say it again

Well I got a girl with a record machine,
When it comes to rocking she's a queen.
I took her to a dance on a saturday night,
All alone where I can hold her tight.
She lives on the twentieth floor uptown.
The elevator's broken down.

And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag.
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock.

You know she called me up on the telephone,
Said come on ever baby 'cause I'm all alone.
I said baby you're mighty sweet,
But I'm in bed with aching feet.
This went on for a couple of days,
But I couldn't stay away.

And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag.
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock.

Well I sent to Chicago for repairs,
Till it's fixed I'm using the stairs.
I hope they hurry, before it's too late,
I want my baby too much to wait.
All this climbing is getting me down,
They'll find me hanging over the rail.

And I walk one, two flight, three flight four,
Five six seven flight, eight flight more.
Up on the twelfth I'm starting to sag,
Fifteenth floor I'm ready to drag.
I get to the top and I'm too tired to rock.

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

I'd love to turn you on

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones. There you go
Yeah... yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans, exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet you're probably sick of me now ain't you mama?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take them bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show""

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

I'm sorry mama!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight

As cold and dark as stone
The rain is falling
It chills us to the bone

Make tomorrow yesterday
But our tears of rage will break it down
The storm is on its way

Tomorrow we may wake up
And pray we dreamed it all
But today the sky grows darker
And the rain will fall

Facts are fake and friends are foes
And how the story ends nobody knows
Cruel is kind and lost is found
And the truth goes round and round and round and round

The rain is falling
As cold and dark as stone
The rain is falling
It chills us to the bone

One day we may be lifted
High up above it all
But today the sky grows darker
And the rain will fall
Yes the rain will fall

It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love,
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance of rain
But my baby's in town,
And we're gonna do some winter things

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

My baby's in town
And we're gonna do some winter things
Hey

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's a hundred degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice and no chills,
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town,
And we're gonna do some winter things
Hey

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

My baby's in town
And we're gonna do some winter things
Hey

Just imagine that we're laughing
In my cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Hey-oh, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby

My baby's in town
And we're gonna do some winter things

Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto-living

These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it you'll keep going down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out

You keep on falling
And no one can hear you calling
So you end up self-destructing

On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine

'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holding on to what God gave me

'Cause that's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
And eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto
'Cause that's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
And eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

No need to cherish luxuries
'Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
'Cause you're not promised tomorrow

So live your life as if every day's gon' be your last
Once you move forward can't go back
Best prepare to remove your past

'Cause you gotta be willing to pray
Yes there gotta be, yeah, gotta be a better way
Yes you gotta be willing to pray
'Cause there gotta be, yeah, gotta be a better day

Whoever said that this struggle would stop today
A lot of niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growing up with AIDS

'Cause that's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto
That's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or eating in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

Gun shots every night
In the ghetto
Crooked cops on sight
In the ghetto
Every day is a fight
In the ghetto, ghetto
Got kids to feed
In the ghetto
Selling coke and weed
In the ghetto
Every day somebody bleed
In the ghetto, ghetto

That's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or living by the ghetto
Or eating in the ghetto, ghetto
That's the life
When you're living in the ghetto
Or sleeping in the ghetto
Living in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto

And that I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me (give a little time to me)
We'll play hide and seek (we'll play hide and seek)
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love........

Love me, love me, love me, give me love, give me love!

[Mic Righteous]
As youth we used to play games 
like Hide and Seek and Simon Says 
and then we realized 
we’re not mice, we’re men
and that was kinda dead. 
For one more time, let’s play Simon Says
But this time, it’s not Simon, ‘cause Simon’s Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
like it meant your final breathe, yeah, 
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop 
You could spend your time,
so it don’t matter if you’re poor or not. 
Give me that real love
Something you could feel, love, 
Maybe it could heal ya 
Just like the first time you said it 
Give me love
‘cause hate is the worst kind of weapon
It’s like I finally see the person in my reflection.

3988,Elvis Presley,1967.0,Who Needs Money,"soundtrack: ""Clambake""","

I'm on the right track for lots of kissin'
So that old greenback, I won't be missin'
All the greatest things in life are free
Who needs money, not me

Cash or credit, it doesn't matter
Long as my bank books keep growin' fatter
Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money, I do

Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worryin' about their income tax
Why waste time on high financin', I'd rather spend it on good romancin'
What if my pockets are empty as can be
Who needs money, not me
Tell me about it

Some folks save it, some folks lend it
But as for me I want to spend it
Give me some green and my skies will be blue
Who needs money, I do

Stocks and bonds, they only bore me
Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
Who needs money, not me

When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep

Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
Who needs money, not me

What do you want

I want a big yacht, I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two
Who needs money, I do

Any time some gal starts flirtin'
Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality
Tell me, who needs money not me

Poverty's the only thing that money cannot buy
So rich or poor it pays to have M-O-N-E-Y

A gal who's tender, that's what I love

It's legal tender, I want a pile of
Just let my liquid assets overflow

You can't take it with you when you go
So, who needs money

That lovely, lovely money

Who needs money, not me

Felt like a Friday night to me
Never wanna leave this bed
Tell me that you got nowhere to be
Can we stay all day?
Lay low in our lazy luxury
Sex in a rosé daze
All day, it's a real good thing

Just like that
There you go, making it hard to stay on track
Got shit to do, you got work
But we fall right back
Into bed, like it's all just a game
And we can't help that, no we can't help that
And we fall right back
Just like that

If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?
Seven in the morning, wanna listen to Britney?
Anything you wanna baby, that's okay with me now
(We don't sleep, but we like sleeping in)
Closing up the curtains while you call out of work
Now I'm turning off my phone while you take off your shirt
Waste another day, another night, another weekend
We don't sleep, but we like sleeping in

Everyday's a holiday
We stay hot when it's cold outside, y'know
Haven't left your place in days
Postmates and dirty laundry

Just like that
There you go, making it hard to stay on track
We got shit to do, you got work

The first time I saw you I knew I was hooked on somebody other than me
The first time I held you, your soft lips and blue eyes
Were as far as my eyes could see

Yes here in my arms I knew I had found the reason that I'm living for
And I felt the feeling, such a wonderful feeling
That I'd never felt before

Baby, you're love's been a long time coming
Baby your love's got a hold on me
Baby your love's sure got me humming
Baby your love's been a long time coming

Deep in my heart there's a feeling I never knew
Until I saw a love that was very new
I'm gonna tell everyone what good love can do

Baby, you're love's been a long time coming

Please, let's forget my past,

And let us say I do,

Join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic host proclaim
""Christ is born in Bethlehem!""

Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of the favored one.
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see;
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with men to dwell,

Hark! the herald angels sing,

Hail! the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail! the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry

I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart
Quicker than a shock
When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor
When I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)

You waited this long now stop debating
'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that
Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits
Fuck you, Debbie!

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution
Polluting the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass
You ask for me?

Well I'm back
Fix your bent antennae
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me
You don't know me
You're too old
Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong

Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, ""We did it""
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them

Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare

When you turn around can you recognize my face?

Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way
Back home (no way back home)
Oh, but I have to say

Leaving home ain't easy
Oh, I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh, there's a million things
A-calling me back
Leaving home ain't easy
On the one you're leaving home

Stay my love
My love, please stay
Don't stray, my love
What's wrong, my love?
What's right, my love?

Leaving on your own

Leaving home ain't necessarily
The only way

Forever on side by side

Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo

I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

If you had sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band...
Look at yourself
Do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a-jumble
I sit around in sadly mumble
Fools rush in, so here I am!
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore and I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad...
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy

You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks

I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again

Merry-go-round
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merry-go-round
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes, who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

Looking for someone
Who would want to stay
I might find her
With a bit of luck one day
But who knows
So until then
I can only try and try again

Merry-go-round
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merry-go-round
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes, who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

Merry-go-round
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merry-go-round
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes, who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

I'm not prepared for the future
So many things that I just don't know, I
Cut my hair, bought a new shirt
New pair of shoes and
It's time to go, I
Finally found an apartment
Signed a lease on a car this month, I
Can't go back to the start now
Time doesn't slow down
I'm on my own

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm telling all my friends we'll get together next October
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum

Never thought I'd be twenty
Now thirty don't seem so far away
I know I gotta make a little money then maybe find somebody
To call my own
Mmm, I'm not ready but I
Can't go back in time, I
Know it's all out my control
Now I know

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm telling all my friends we'll get together next October

Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum

Guess my childhood is over
One day I'll be buying posters for my kids
Just like my parents did for me, it's never over
They'll grow up and soon enough
They'll wish that time would just move slower
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure

Someone to hold you too close
Someone to hurt you too deep
Someone to sit in your chair
And ruin your sleep
And make you aware of being alive

Someone to need you too much
Someone to know you too well
Someone to pull you up short
And put you through hell
And give you support for being alive-being alive
Make me alive, make me confused
Mock me with praise, let me be used
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!

Somebody hold me too close
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
I'll always be there
As frightened as you of being alive,
Being alive, being alive!

Someone you have to let in
Someone whose feelings you spare
Someone who, like it or not
Will want you to share a little, a lot of being alive
Make me alive, make me confused
Mock me with praise, let me be used
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!

Somebody crowd me with love
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through

Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting

Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting

What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?

Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting

Go and hide and run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right...

Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn

But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm
Still hurting

There was a man, a lonely man
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence

And Solitaire is the only game in town
And every road that takes him, takes him down
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire

And keeping to himself begins to deal
And still the King of Hearts is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And deals them out again

A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he's playing

And every road that takes him, takes him down

I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down to suicide road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.

I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, whoever would have guessed
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.

Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit he's beaten 'til he's tame
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.

There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet
I've paid the price of solitude but at least I'm out of debt.

I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other's eyes 'till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make ?

So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at
I hate myself for loving you but I should get over that.

I've had so many lives
Since I was a child
And I realize
How many times I've died
I'm not that kind of guy
Sometimes I feel shy
I think I can fly
Closer to the sky

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up

This world is not so kind
People trap your mind
It's so hard to find
Someone to admire
I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

No one's telling you how to live your life
But it's a setup until you're fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

Nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

No one's telling me how to live my life
But it's a setup and I'm just fed up
It's no good when you're misunderstood
But why should I care
What the world thinks of me?
Won't let a stranger
Give me a social disease

I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Reading magazines
I don't want no lies
I don't watch TV
I don't waste my time
Reading magazines

I, I sleep much better at night
I feel closer to the light
Now I'm gonna try
To improve my life

Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Nobody knows me
Like you know me

It's no fun, but the damage is done
Don't want your social disease
Don't want your social disease

I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin
I got you under my skin

There are too many questions
There is not one solution
There is no resurrection
There is so much confusion

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love vibration
You make me feel
You make it shine

There are too many options
There is no consolation
I have lost my illusions
What I want is an explanation

And I know I can feel bad
When I get in a bad mood
And the world can look so sad
Only you make me feel good

And the love profusion
You make me feel
You make me know
And the love intention
You make me feel
You make it shine
You make me feel
You make it shine, you make me feel

Love
Love

There is no comprehension
There is real isolation
There is so much destruction
What I want is a celebration

And the love profusion

You make me know
And the love intention

You make it shine
You make me feel
You make it shine, you make me feel

We sat by the fire
United in song
Under the moonlight
All night long

We sang 'Hallelujah'
For the joy of it all

And out on the water
A caroling loon
Sings us a sweet
Heavenly tune

There's peace in God's forest
The temple of life

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah

And back in the city
I'm losing control
I need a place
To ease my soul

There's peace in God's temple
The temple of life

Hallelujah

We looked to the sky
Deep into heaven's eyes
Hallelujah

Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing ?

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean.

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona ?

Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.

That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin' ?

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow.

I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.

Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'.

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

Now I'm sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning

This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high siddity
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in, whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood?
How they turn their nose up like they don't come from the hood?
Most of them be in sight 'til it's time to pitch in
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich, I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can't do no more

When I'm granting they wishes they be passing their digits
They be up on the block getting screwed by the cops
Cutting school, getting knocked whether they like it or not
They'll break in your door
Might break in your jaw
They'll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know
They're airborne for stardom
With the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin'
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant

Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You've had time to think about it for a while.

Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high
It wont matter who loves who
You'll love me or I'll love you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.

I can't provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie ?
You'll know all about it, love
It'll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver
I've never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die
Stick around, baby, we're not through
Don't look for me, I'll see you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don't want to be a fool starving for affection
I don't want to drown in someone else's wine.
For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that's howling in your eye
You will seek me and you'll find me
In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
When you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When my memory is not so short.

This time I'm asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you'll give it to me now
I'll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling 
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky.

[Verse 1: Akon]
These streets remind me of quicksand (quicksand)
When your on it you'll keep goin down (goin down)
And there's noone to hold on too
And there's noone to pull you out
You keep on fallin (falling)
And noone can here you callin
So you end up self destructing
On the corner with the tuli on the waist line just got outta the bing doin state time
Teeth marks on my back from the canine
Dark Memories of when there was no sunshine
Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
(I remember like yesterday)
Holdin on to what God gave me...

[Verse 2: Ali B - dutch]
Je kijkt om je heen maar kan niet geloven wat je ziet
Een gebied vol verdriet hele wijk is falliet
Een bandiet die weer schiet in de ronte voor niets het is een
Plek waar je vermoord word voor een simpele fiets
Ik heb het over de ghetto's van de verenigde staten
Waar kinderen van twaalf rond lopen met een wapen
Maar ook in nederland is het niet altijd wat het lijkt criminaliteit
Stijgt in de achterstandswijk kijk ik wil niet zeggen
Dat de bijlmer als new york is maar heel veel van die mensen
Doen of het een dorp is waar nooit iets gebeurd terwijl
De flats zijn bezet door de junks aan de crack je houd jezelf
Voor de gek...

[Chorus: Akon]
This goes out to my tata's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
My mocro's in tha (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)
Cause this goes out to the anti's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
The yugo's in tha (ghetto) ghetto ooh we livin in tha...

[Verse 2: Yes-R - dutch]
Jongens stap het liefst je verdriet is diep van binnen
Je wilt wel opnieuw beginnen maar je word geconfronteerd
En je ziet van die dingen je broertje gearesteerd
Je vader zakt zachtjes neer je moeder kan niet meer
Het doet je zeer
Je dropt die tranen kijkt uit het raam het is alsof je wijk is getroffen door een orkaan overal liggen vuilnis zakken
Er lopen ratten junkies die elkaar om een bolletje willen klappen
Politie rijdt voorbij en ziet iedereen als verdachte
In een keiharde wereld is er geen ruimte voor een zwarte
Survivor of the fittest is hoeveel heb je in petto heet is de
Eeuwen oude vraag als je leeft in de ghetto...

[Chorus: Akon]
This goes out to my tata's in tha (ghetto)
Maluku's in tha (ghetto)
My mocro's in tha (ghetto) ghetto (ghetto)

I'll know when my love comes along

How I care, how I care, how I care...
And I'll stop...

And I'll know
Long before we can speak!

I will know and I won't ever ask
Am I right, am I wise, am I smart?'
But I but I'll stop, and I'll stare at that face in the throng
Yes, I'll know when my love comes along
There he'll stand before my eyes one day

2998,Bob Dylan,,Marchin' To The City,,"

Well I'm sittin' in church in an old wooden chair
I knew nobody would look for me there
Sorrow and pity rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothin' in anyone's eyes

Once I had a pretty gal, did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

Snow flakes are fallin' around my head
Lord have mercy, it feel heavy like lead
I been hit too hard, seen too much
Nothing can heal me now but your touch

Once I had a pretty gal, she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

Loneliness got a mind of its own
The more people around, the more you feel alone
I'm chained to the earth like a silent slave
Trying to break free out of death's dark cave

Once I had a pretty gal, done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

Boys in the street beginnin' to play
Girls like birds flyin' away
I'm carryin' the roses that were given to me
And I'm thinkin' about paradise wonderin' where it might be

Once I had a pretty gal, she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

Go over to London, maybe gay Paris
Follow the river you get to the sea
I was hopin' we could drink from life's clear streams
I was hopin' we could dream life's pleasant dreams

Once I had a pretty gal, but she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

Well the weak get weaker and the strong stay strong
The train keeps rollin' all night long
She looked at me with an irresistable glance
With a smile that could make all the planets dance

Once I had a pretty gal, she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

My house is on fire, burnin' to the skies
I thought the rain clouds, but the clouds passed by
When I'm gone you'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and fame

Once I had a pretty gal, but she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city and the road ain't long

Erase you on Monday

Went straight back to sideways

Too bad for you

Give a hundred million reasons
But why could you believe them?
Too bad for you

Yeah we fight and we fuck
Until we open the cuts

People, do we call this trying?
We're hopeless, forget the denying
Our souls are corrupt
Our minds are messed up
Our consciences, bankrupt
Oh, we're fucked

People, what are we thinking?
It's shameful, our standards are sinking
We're barely hanging on
Our spirit has gone
And once where it shone
I hear a lonesome song

People, how are we coping?
It's futile to even start hoping
That justice will prevail
That truth will tip the scales
Our dignity has sailed

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders

'Till I was hers

Just to wake up by your side

Would've sold my soul
For a little more time
Would've waited a thousand nights

Would've sold my soul for a little more time

Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle

And his mouth was a gospel horn

Yet bold and brave he stood
Salvation in his hand
Go blow them ram horns Joshua cried
'Cause the devil can't do you no harm

Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down

Up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with spear in hand
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried
'Cause the battle is in my hands

Then the lamb ram sheep horns began to blow
The trumpets began to sound
Old Joshua shouted glory
And the walls came tumblin' down

God knows that
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down

Down, down, down, down, down
Tumblin' down

Not guilty
For getting in your way, while you try to steal the day
Not guilty
I'm not nodding for the rest, I'm not trying to steal you vest
I end up trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head, but like you heard me said
Not guilty

Though you signing me a writ, while I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your hoard I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed, but like you heard me said

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

2443,Barbra Streisand,2009.0,Where Do You Start?,"""Love Is The Answer""","

Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

2741,Bob Dylan,1981.0,Lenny Bruce,"""Shot Of Love""","

Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, that's for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit's living on and on.

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies' heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.

Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn't commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before it's time
I rode with him in a taxi once, only for a mile and a half
Seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and the ones that killed him are gone.

They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

2703,Bob Dylan,1976.0,Isis,"""Desire""","

I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong

I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down

A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch?""
I said ""I got no money."" He said ""That ain't necessary.""

We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him a blanket, and he gave me his word
I said ""Where are we going?"" He said ""We'll be back by the fourth.""
I said ""That's the best news that I've ever heard.""

I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless

How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said

We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price""
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind

The wind it was a-howling and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on

I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her

She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead

She said ""Where ya been?"" I said ""No place special""
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well, I guess""
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""
She said ""You gonna stay?"" I said ""If you want me to, yes.""

Isis oh Isis you're a mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain

Seem to catch up to her

By the time I got there she was gone
And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound
So pretty, so gritty, so funny that no one's around
So I locked myself inside and closed the door
But there was this funny feeling inside
That I couldn't get rid of, then I sing it

Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall

Standin' in front of my window pane

The more she play the more I feel the pain
Why is she doing this, what's it to gain?

Seems like she tryna take my soul away
Startin' to feel I'm under her control today
I can't see her but I hear her from the shades
And it seems like she really knows me

Every fiddle makes me wanna run away

2850,Bob Dylan,2006.0,Thunder On The Mountain,"""Modern Times""","

Thunder on the mountain, and there's fires on the moon 
A ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, where I'm gonna grab my trombone and blow 
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go 

I was thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying 
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line 
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be 
I been looking for her even clear through Tennessee

Feel like my soul is beginning to expand 
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand 
You brought me here, now you're trying to turn me away 
The writing on the wall, come read it, come see what it does say 

Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum 
Going to sleep over there, that's where the music is coming from 
I don't need any guide, I already know the way 
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day 

The pistols are popping and the power is down 
I'd like to try something but I'm so far from town 
The sun keeps shining and the North Wind keeps picking up speed 
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need 

I've been sitting down studying the art of love 
I think it will fit me like a glove 
I want some real good woman to do just what I say 
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today 

Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground 
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down 
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my King 
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing 

Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches 
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages 
I been to St. Herman's church, said my religious vows 
As I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows 

I've got the pork chops, she's got the pie 
She ain't no angel and neither am I 
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes 
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams 

Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be 
Mean old twister bearing down on me 
All the ladies in Washington scrambling to get out of town 
Looks like something bad is going to happen, better roll your airplane down 

Everybody going and I want to go too 
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new 
I did all I could, I did it right there and then 
I've already confessed, no need to confess again 

Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up North 
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth 
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf 
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself.

Out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor

Switches on his radio

In the audience
Watching the show
With a paper in his hand
(In his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh!

Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down

Late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers
Wade in the jar
Till the evening is complete

3010,Bob Dylan,,Tell Ol' Bill,,"

The river whispers in my ear
I've hardly a penny to my name
The heavens have never seemed so near
All of my body glows with flame

The tempest struggles in the air
And to myself alone I sing
It could sink me then and there
I can hear the echoes ring

I tried to find one smiling face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lying restless in a heavy bed

Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come down off of your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind

Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me, you'll understand
Emotions we can never share

You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now

I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gate

Beneath the thunder blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
Stars are cold, the night is young

The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floating by
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky

The evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The woods are dark, the town isn't new
They''ll drag you down, they'll run the show
Ain't no telling what they'll do

Tell ol' Bill when he comes home
Anything is worth a try
Tell him that I'm not alone
That the hour has come to do or die

All the world I would defy
Let me make it plain as day
I look at you now and I sigh
How could it be any other way?

Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

I'm living like a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Moving slow in this McLaren so they all can see me
Nigga waiting out of tune, shit is so easy
I'm living life, I'm on top of mine
And there's nobody here on Earth could ever stop my grind
Say slow money, it's better than make it none at all
So I'm taking my time because I'm need it all
Paper chasing, getting money you on another level
But still I'm rocking with them goons and them fucking rebels
Ain't a movie a spril life, I really live it
If you heard me talk about it then I probably did it
Real talk slow down take your time homie
Go hard, go home when it's time homie

Keep slurring keep pawing swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

I'm living like a slow mo
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Slow motion, fuck the speed limit slow mo
I like a life skin bitch 5-4
Got my true religions on with the bank roll
Got your girl live long like a feel go
Real dough, I give dough
That 72 Chevelle made me feel hoe
Behold, say I've conceeded
In my ever bullshit and no need me
Kill me on the east with a lot of two little spices and some jolly rinces
All black cars like the fucking black pimpers
I smoke so many poes that I might catch cancer

Keep slurring keep pawing swerving out of control
Stevie Wonder's own eyes damn near closed
Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Rockin' native, thigh slidin' on them dudes foes
Fuck the speed limit bitch I'm living life in slow mo

Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest [*burp*] fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
""Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said.""
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away [*slam*]
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single [*burp*]
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle [*burp*]
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle [*fart*]
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle [*fart*]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it ...blblblblblblblb... – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, ""Ni—""
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
""Ga-hu"" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', ""I'm gon—nuh cum!""

And this was supposed to be. my first single [*burp*]
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle [*burp*]
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

And this was supposed to be my first single [*burp*]
But I just fucked that up, so

So you feel that you ain't nobody
Always needed to be somebody
Put your feet on the ground
Put your hand on your heart
Lift your head to the stars
And the world's for your taking

(All you gotta do is save the world)

So you feel it's the end of the story
Find it all pretty satisfactory
Well I tell you my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation
Is yours for the making

Yes you're a hero (oooh yeah)

He's for every one of us
Stands for every one of us
He saved with a mighty hand (with a mighty hand)
Every man every woman 
Every child he's the mighty

2584,Bob Dylan,1965.0,Desolation Row,"""Highway 61 Revisited""","

They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row.

Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning,
""You belong to Me I Believe.""
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave.""
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row.

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row.

Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row.

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
NOW, he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row.

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They ARE trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play on the penny whistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough

From Desolation Row.
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon-feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
""Get outta here if you don't know""
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row.

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row.

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
""Which side are you on?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row.

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the door knob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Or was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row.

Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars

You made us feel like we could fly

2655,Bob Dylan,1973.0,The Ballad Of Ira Hayes,"""Dylan""","

Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms wene crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.

Love like everybody does, everybody does
The dove and the sparrow singing songs above the fly
Water runs like blood

The cupid and his henchman are sitting on a fence
And picking out their targets one by one
Some try to fight against them and some try to find protection
And some get wounded while they're on the run

Sticks and stones and human bones are all crumbling like paper
I just want my love to know that I went out to save her
I went and got my feelings caught, I tried to vindicate her
I got shot and she did not, her broken hearted savior

It went down to the marrow
When it hit me I went numb like a razor through a plum
The dove calls the sparrow but he got caught up in the madness
He was easy target practice
Singing as he crashes

Cupid and his henchman are sitting on a fence
And they are picking out their targets one by one
Some try to fight against them and some try to find protection
And some get wounded while they're on the run

Sticks and stones and human bones are all crumbling like paper
I just want my love to know that I went out to save her
I went and got my feelings caught, I tried to vindicate her
I got shot and she did not, her broken hearted savior

And she can thank me later
And she can thank me later
And she can thank me later

Sticks and stones and human bones are all crumbling like paper
I just want my love to know that I went out to save her
I went and got my feelings caught, I tried to vindicate her
I got shot and she did not, her broken hearted savior

I believe your new girl turned you down 
And they say she's pushing you around 
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride 
Tell me my friend how many nights you cried 

Disaster and disgrace 
The king has lost his crown 
Suddenly 
He's clumsy like a clown 
Aaaaah 
The world is upside down 
The king has lost his crown 

Was it hard to step down from your throne 
And to know tonight you're all alone 
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl 
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her 

Disaster and disgrace 
The king has lost his crown 
Suddenly 
He's clumsy like a clown 
Ha-aaaahh 
The world is upside down 
The king has lost his crown 

Disaster and disgrace 
The word is all around 
Suddenly 
He's clumsy like a clown 
Aaaaaaa-ah 
The world is upside down 
The king has lost his crown

He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him, Find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He just a young boy Looking for a way to find love

He doesn't need another helping hand from someone
But don't you think he doesn't understand what he wants, Someone
Though independence means a lot he got to still be strong
He just a young boy Looking for a way to find love

Find Love, a perfect combination
Find Love, whatever you do
Find Love, a cause for celebration
Then it might come looking, come looking for you

Find love in any situation
Find Love, whatever you do
Find Love, a cause for celebration
And it might come looking, come looking for you

He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy nothing you can say will help him, Find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy Looking for a way to find love

Find love, a time for meditation
Find love, a source for inspiration
Find love, instead of confrontation
And love will come looking for you

Money.
Money...
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money
So you go to church
Read the Holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You'll do anything for money...

Anything

Would lie for you

Anything

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cause your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You'll do anything for money...

Good morning! Ha ha!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well, come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get past these little piss ants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's scrap and then it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin' you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like Krazy Glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50
I'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Keith Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof, are you with me?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

They consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
In a party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs, I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs, they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death project, you stop breathin'
You die quicker than Mach speed without bleedin'
It ain't about what you readin'
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefin' frequent
You niggas need an 'E' just to speak shit
Your leader's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning

I heard you niggas don't like us but so what?
This beef is like ""What the fuck did he say in his rap, Em?""
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: ""Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!""
What! I might as well give this up but that'd be, selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, c'mon!

I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you seriously, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at Gs
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin' if you coming

Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in

We make our agreements
About when to meet
And I'll leave you in the doorway
The cold evening aches
As it leaves in its wake
Oh, the memories left by the day

Oh, and questioning why
As you look to the sky
That is cloudless up above our heads
And thoughts come to mind
How our short little lives
Haven't left the path that they will tread

They will tread...

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

Will wisdom we learn
As our minds they do burn
All the ties to naivety and youth
To adults we grow
And maturity shows
Oh the terrifying rarity of truth

As you turn to your mind
And youth thoughts they rewind
To old happenings and things that are done
You can't find what's past
Make that happiness last
Seeing from those eyes what you've become

What you've become...

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

I will see you there
Will see you there
Will see you there...

I'll come back to haunt you
Memories will taunt you
And I will try to love you
It's not like I'm above you

See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.

I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.

Eat a fuckin' dick (Yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (Woo!)
On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics

I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray
I'm turnin' back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basal ganglia's an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets
Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
'Cause, damn it, I'm still the

Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world
No lie, I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white
But I'm the greatest

So you sold ten million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh? (Haha! Wait)
What was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I mispronounced a name, ""DIE ANTWOORD!""
Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget
Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress (Woo!)
This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to
Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever
I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop

But I'm the greatest

Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (What?)
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling

You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring

If we can do it
We can save the day

The engineer lives with his wife and daughter Janet
But he misses them so
Although he's working with the best crew on the planet
(The best crew on the planet!)
They never want him to go

He had a premonition
He senses something's wrong
And by his own admission

How can we stop him
Grab the keys and lock him up

The captain's gonna leave us when the temperatures rise
The needle's going up, the engine's gonna blow
And we are gonna be left down below

Yes we can do it

Yeah, we can do it now
Yes we can do it
Yeah, we can do it now

Sometimes you might have to battle through it
But that's the way you learn how you've got to do it

You're Getting In Deep Whatever You Do,
Don't Let Me Go Back To Sleep,
Don't Be Careless Love,
Don't Be Careless Love,
Don't Be, Don't Be Careless.
Saw Your Face In The Morning Paper,
Saw Your Body Rolled Up In A Rug
Chopped Up Into Two Little Pieces
By Some Thug,
Don't Be Careless Love,
Be Careless Love.
But In The Morning Light
When I Wake Up Again
You're By My Side And That's The Way It's Always Been,
But In The Dark Your Mind Plays Funny Tricks On You,
Your Mind Plays Funny Tricks On You,
Your Mind Plays Funny Tricks On You,
Don't Be Careless Love.

Lift up your head
And remember what your life is
Don't have to give it all away
When you're left for dead
In the middle of a crisis
You must appreciate the day

There's something there
But you're frightened to invite it
Beware of pushing it away
Show that you care
And be certain you don't fight it
You must appreciate the day

She says you don't give back what you take
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love
She says it's all a show and no-go
You drop everything, give back
Reciprocate her love

My Brave Face.
I've Been Living In Style
Unaccustomed As I Am To The Luxury Life.
I've Been Hitting The Town And It Didn't Hit Back.

I've Been Doing The Rounds
Unaccustomed As I Am To The Time On My Hands.
Now I Don't Have To Tell Anybody When I'm Gonna Get Back.

Ever Since You Went Away I've Had This Sentimental
Inclination Not To Change A Single Thing.
As I Pull The Sheets Back On The Bed I Want To Go Bury My Head
In Your Pillow.

Now That I'm Alone Again, I Can't Stop Breaking Down Again,
The Simplest Things Set Me Off Again
And Take Me To That Place
Where I Can't Find My Brave Face
Where I Can't Find My Brave Face
My Brave, My Brave, My Brave Face.

I've Been Living A Lie
Unaccustomed As I Am
To The Work Of A Housewife,
I've Been Breaking Up
Dirty Dishes And Throwing Them Away.

Ever Since You Left I Have Been Trying To
Compose A ""Baby Will You Please Come Home"" Note
Meant For You.
As I Clear Away Another
Untouched Tv Dinner
From The Table I Laid For Two.

Now That I'm Alone Again
I Can't Stop Breaking Down Again,
The Simplest Things Set Me Off Again
And Take Me To That Place

Where I Can't Find My Brave Face,

Funny day
Looking for laughter
And finding it there
Sunny day
Braiding wild flowers
And leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil
And wrote ""I LOVE YOU""
In my finest hand
Wanted to send it
But I don't know
Where I stand
Telephone
Even the sound of your voice
Is still new
All alone in California
I'm talking to you
I'm feeling too foolish and strange
To say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early
Cause I don't know
Where I stand
Doo-doo-doo-ooh
Crickets call
Courting the ladies
In starred apple green
Thicket's tall
Until the morning
Comes up like a dream
How muted and misty
Such rouse
And I'll take
What sleep I can
I know that I miss you
But I don't know
Where I stand
I know that I miss you

Just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down
The view from the cliffs

Now you're stranded all alone
And the path leads unknown
And there is no easy way down
No it isn't very easy

And there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home

Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end
When it's time to descend
There is no easy way down

[Barbra:] Look, I've spent a lot of time working on this
[Producer 1:] Look, no one's gonna buy it -- no one.
[Producer 2:] No one in Middle America, anyway. That's for sure.
[Producer 3:] He's right!
[Producer 1:] Sweetheart, it's just not commercial!
[Barbra:] What is commercial?
[Producer 2:] It's not what's selling nowadays.
[Producer 1:] I mean - personally, I love it, but
[Barbra (sung):]Be nice, girl!
[Producer 3:] Nobody's into this kind of material.
[Barbra (sung):] You have to pay a price, girl!
[Producer 2:] This album needs a hit single we can push.
[Barbra (sung):]They like to give advice, girl!
[Producer 1:] The whole idea's too risky.
[Barbra (sung):] Don't think about it twice, girl!
[Producer 2:] The audience won't understand this kind of thing!
[Barbra (sung):]It's time to get to work!
Barbra (spoken): I disagree! Why don't you wait until you hear it?
[Producer 3:] This is like your old stuff!
[Barbra (sung):] Art isn't easy.
[Producer 3:] You've got to appeal to the kids.
[Barbra (sung):] Even when you're hot.
[Producer 2:] Why would you want to make an album like this anyway?
[Barbra (sung):] Advancing art is easy.
[Producer 1:] I think we ought to talk seriously about this.
[Barbra (sung):] Financing it is not!
[Producer 2:] Why take chances?
[Barbra (sung):] A vision's just a vision if it's only in your head!
[Producer 1:] Nobody respects your artistic integrity more than I do, but
[Barbra (sung):] If no one gets to hear it, it's as good as dead!
[Producer 2:] You have to think about you career!
[Barbra (sung):] It has to come to life!
Bit by bit, putting it together
Piece by piece, only way to make a work of art
Every moment makes a contribution
Every little detail plays a parts
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
Putting it together, that's what counts!
Ounce by ounce, putting in together
Small amounts, adding up to make a work of art
First of all you need a good foundation
Otherwise it's risky from the start
Takes a little cocktail conversation
But without the proper preparation
Having just a vision's no solution
Everything depends on execution
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
[Producer 2:] Do we really need all these musicians?
[Barbra:] Link by link, making the connections, yes we do!
Drink by drink, taking every comment as it comes
Learning how to play the politician
Like you play piano, bass and drums
Otherwise you'll find your composition
Isn't gonna get much exhibition
Art isn't easy
Every minor detail is a major decision
Have to keep things in scale
Have to hold to your vision
[Producer 1:] Why don't we talk about this over dinner, darling?
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation
Every time I start to feel defensive
I remember vinyl is expensive!
[Producer 3:] Would you agree to do an interview?
[Barbra:] Maybe one!
Dot by dot, building up the image
Shot by shot, keeping at a distance doesn't pay
Still if you remember your objective
Not give all your privacy away
A little bit of hype can be effective
As long as you can keep it in perspective
Even when you get some recognition
Everything you do you still audition
Art isn't easy
Overnight you're a trend
You're the right combination
Then the trend's at an end
You're suddenly last year's sensation!
All they ever want is repetition
All they really like is what they know
Gotta keep a link with your tradition
Gotta learn to trust your intuition
While you re-establish your position
So that you can be on exhibit...
So that your work can be on exhibition!
Be new, girl!
They tell you till they're blue, girl!
You're new, or else you're through, girl!
And even if it's true, girl,
You do what you can do!
Bit by bit, Putting it together
Piece by piece, working on the vision night and day
All it takes is time and perseverance
With a little luck along the way
Putting in a personal appearance
Gathering supporters and adherents...
[Producer 1:] Well, she's an original!
[Producer 3:] WAS!
[Barbra:] Mapping out the songs but in addition
Harmonizing each negotiation
Balancing the part that's all musicians
With the part that's strictly presentation
Balancing the money with the mission
Till you have the perfect orchestration
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration
The art of making art
Is putting it together, bit by bit
Beat by beat, part by part
Sheet by sheet, chart by chart
Track by track, bit by bit,
Reel by reel, pout by pout
Stack by stack, snit by snit,
meal by meal, shout by shout
Deal by deal, spat by spat
Shpiel by shpiel, doubt by doubt
And that... Is the state of the art!

You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, ""Fuck you!""
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you have
'Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love
I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please

And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, ""Fuck you!""
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused 'cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
'Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we could've had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done being your punching bag

It was November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you (uh) 'cause you made me (uh) a better person than I was
But I hate you (uh) 'cause you drained me (uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (uh), you're crazy (uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream, ""Fuck you!""
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

Yeah, I can taste it, it's the end
This love's impossible to save
Though you embrace it, I can't face it
So I look the other way
There's trouble in your eyes
But I pretend that we're okay
I wish that we could compromise
But there's just nothing left to say

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

Trying to light a match in the rain
Like flying a kite in a hurricane
Like riding a bike with no air or chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game
Trying to light a match in the rain
Like flying a kite in a hurricane

Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' 'bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a Gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
'Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin-Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, ""Wetter than jacuzzi bitches""

Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch

Half a bar, just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch

Don't ya tell Henry
Apple's got your fly.

I went down to the river on a saturday morn
A-lookin' around just to see who's born
I found a little chicken down on his knees
I went up and yelled to him
""Please, please, please""
He said, ""Don't ya tell Henry
Don't ya tell Henry
Don't ya tell Henry
Apple's got your fly"".

I went down to the corner at a-half past ten
I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when
I looked down low, I looked above
And who did I see but the one I love
She said, ""Don't ya tell Henry
Don't ya tell Henry
Don't ya tell Henry
Apple's got your fly"".

Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve
A-lookin' around just to see myself
I spotted a horse and a donkey too
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few
The said, ""Don't ya tell Henry
Don't ya tell Henry
Don't ya tell Henry
Apple's got your fly"".

Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night
A-lookin around, it was outa sight
I looked high and low for that big ol' tree
I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me
I said, ""Don't ya tell Henry

3014,Bob Dylan,,Things Have Changed,,"

A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose

[Chorus:]
People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

This place ain’t doing me any good
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove

Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through

[Chorus]

I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can’t win with a losing hand

Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

[Chorus]

I hurt easy, I just don’t show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me

Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I’m not that eager to make a mistake

[Chorus]

Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it

Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

'Cause I, see right through you, boy
And I, I ain't feeling you no more
I ain't feelin' you no more

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better

Play with tea, you get burned from it

He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight (sheesh)
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like

Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better

You would do better

Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance
(We can do it again)

We drove close, closer and closer
And even though we’re almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I’m taking you away
Tonight

Come together all the people (we can do it now)
Here’s your chance to make it right (go, take a chance)
And even though we’re gettin’ close
We’re not there just yet
And even though we’re almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I’m taking you away
Then one more time close your eyes
I’m always here to stay
(oh)
Tonight

(I’m always here)
(Oh I)

We can do it again

Shifted from town to town
No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy

Till I find my place there's no doubt...

My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a rovin' roustabout

And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye
I'll give her a quick ""hello"", and a fast goodbye

I'll go the way I want
Driftin' just like the sand
Doin' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose

Once again it's the... illest and realest killers

Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners? This music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished
And G-Unit spinners will keep spinning
This is hip-hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next?
He's already reconciled with his ex
A chainsaw and an axe
Choke a bitch to death, strangle her neck

Every day Dre day, front and cause a melee
Turn the town upside-down with a frown upside-down

I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you straight facts
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back! (Now)

Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance
I'm in a trance

Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows
Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why
This is how creation goes

I don't want nobody else ('Body else)
All the others look the same (The same)
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name

I'm in a trance and the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go
I'm in a trance and the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Kiss me, kiss me
Kiss me, kiss me

I like to singy, singy, singy
Like a bird on a wingy, wingy, wingy
I like to rhumba, rhumba, rhumba
Dance to a samba, samba, samba

I'm in a trance and the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go
I'm in a trance and the word is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Trance 
I'm in a trance

Nothing out there looks the same
You're the one that I've been waiting for

Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

Draw me no maps, vow me no vows
No they-perhaps, just here-and-nows
Tomorrow's dream is not my dream
It comes too late and I can't wait
The river runs with one remark
Get on your way, it's growing dark
And so I live to have my say
To get and give each burning day
And if in time I find my love
He'll find that I'm no frightened dove
For all too soon young love is passed
It's tender leaves fall off too fast
Each rising hill, each falling stream
Cause to fulfill each day's new dream
Some brighter road to fly along
Some stronger wine, some wilder song
And when I'm gone don't shed one tear
The world will know that I've been here!

Don't get so busy that you miss
Giving just a little kiss
To the ones you love
Don't even wait a little while
To give them just a little smile
A little is enough

How many people are crying
People are dying...
How many people are asking for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love...

How could you wait another minute
A hug is warmer when you're in it
And Baby that's a fact
And saying ""I love you's"" always better
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter
So don't hold back
How many people in this world
So needful in this world
How many people are praying for love

So don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love...

Let all the children know
Everywhere that they go
Their whole life long
Let them know love

Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find a way
To give a little love everyday
Don't save it all for Christmas Day
Find your way
Cause holidays have come and gone
But love lives on
If you give on
Love...

Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

Sailin' round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!

I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
When I paint my masterpiece

Yeah, well when I didn't hear from you. I assu-
Oh, I'm so sorry
It's fine don't worry
I really- meant to call
So how-how's the script?
Uh yeah, it's coming along. It's good. Good, yeah
Good, good. Um... I had my hair cut. Do you like it?
Uh-huh. Yeah. I ha-hang on one second. I'm in the middle of writing something. Hang on
Oh. I'm sorry. Um... I'm- I'm going upstairs
Listen don't- [*sighs*]
What?
Alright. I'll be up

Any moment now, he'll notice me
Me and my butterfly heart
Any moment now he'll turn around and grin
And say ""At last, where have you been?

We're late for daybreak on the Riviera""
If not the Riviera, the beach at Malibu
The rich Madera sunset going on forever
With my arms growing cold
And his arms growing warm with life unfolding

Any moment now, he'll say to me
""Why don't you follow your heart?""
How can he know that I've been praying he'd arrive
Afraid to come alive 'til then
Just saying, any moment now

Listen, can you tell that I'm a little frustrated?
Well, so am I
I mean, I feel like you've been avoiding me
Me, avoiding you?
You-you're avoiding us
Oh
I mean, you're always out having meetings or-
I'm not always out
It would be nice if you just stayed home once in a while. Just the two of us
Well, I wouldn't be much fun, honey. I don't drink
Oh ho- Well, you gotta have something to wash down a frozen dinner
Wow. I don't know how to answer that. Look, I am going to sleep

Any moment now, she'll notice me
Me and my simple guy ways
Any moment now, she said she'll settle down
If that were true, I'd paint the town

I'd take her flying to Atlantic City
If not Atlantic City, to see Niagara Falls
I know a pretty trout stream up above Seattle
What a life we could build in a home that is filled with love and laughter

Any moment now
You'll say to me
You'll humor me
Chase the past
Those overcast days (oooh)
How can I begin forgetting where we've been
To let the laughter in again
It's always any moment now
Oh, any moment now

Promise me we'll talk about this
Sure
When?

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again

In Milltown there's a pub
It’s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they’ll return again

I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

3587,Ed Sheeran,,Don't / Loyal / No Diggity / The Next Episode / Nina,,"

I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right

I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

(knock, knock, knock)
on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

these girls ain't loyal
that heart is soo cold
this girl ain't loyal

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10,
I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it (no diggity)

Thug niggaz drug dealers yeah they givin it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

La-da-da-da-dahh
It's the motherfuckin D.R.E. (snoop doooooog)
La-da-da-da-dahhh
You know I'm mobbin with the D-O-double-G

eyo eyo eyo eyoooooo

But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay

Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone

Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the barb with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now

Follow that dream, I gotta follow that dream
Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need

When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you,
There's just one thing that you can do

Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need

Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving

Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about

I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need

I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead

To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love!
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love!
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never ever be
So with my best, my very best, I set you free!

A cozy fire to keep you warm

You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can't from our stars and stripes 'cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me

Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)

For the cracks in the road that drove me

I won't give up on my home, that so many died for

There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (yeah)

And here's to where we all began, all began (stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[*plane crashing*]

Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts and see where this takes me, 'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now

Yeah, let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brrr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage, but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But, bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown

Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent?
Oh, critiquin' my talent?
Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar, or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but, bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' t-to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adios
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an MC
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea
(Get it)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit
Preferably shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, but spelled)

Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick with an ice pick
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence
Bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip

These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
(Fuck my side chick!)

You won't ever see Em icy, but as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)

Turn down for what? I ain't loud enough
Nah, turn the Valium up! (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now, when it doesn't matter what caliber I spit at
I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us""
(Ooh-ooh)

But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (ooh-ooh)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)

So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with being humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you
That's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are acting like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals should have been auto-tuned
And you would have bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep
Not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze

""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people, each and every one of y'all
If you call a fire engine green, aquamarine
Or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date,"" ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" ""No it's not, it's a peach!""

So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway
Doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite them in like a One A Day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless
It's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshiped
But if I could go back I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted

But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And, yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the ringer
So, I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking

Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe

Made men forget just what they were running after

Taught them to trust their feelings beneath the surface

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think we live in era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a diss, 'cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, rhythm romantically
Freaking vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

The things we used to do
The secrets we once shared

But this heartache isn't going anywhere
In the public eye I act like I don't care
When there's no one watching me

I will always have you, inside of me
Even though you're gone
Love still carries on
Love, inside of me

I keep a picture of you
Next to my bed at night
And when I wake up scared
I know I'll find you there
Watching over me

When my world seems to crumble all around
And foolish people try to bring me down
I just think of your smiling face
And I'm flying

We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Get through the days

This will take you down
Go all the way

He had what you might call a trivial occupation
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
With no romance in his life
Sometimes he wished he had a wife
He read the matrimonial advertising pages
The cries for help from different people, different ages
But they had nothing to say
At least not until the day
When something special he read
This is what it said:

If you dream of the girl for you
Then call us and get two for the price of one
We're the answer if you feel blue
So call us and get two for the price of one
If you dream of the girl for you
(If you are dreaming of someone who might be right for you)
Then call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)
We're the answer if you feel blue
(We may be the answers to your problem, a chance with we two)
So call us and get two for the price of one
(Why don't you call us and you'll get two for the price of one)

He called the number and a voice said, ""Alice Whiting""
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
He was amazed at his luck
The purest streak of gold he'd struck
He said, ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
Why don't we meet for a chat
The three of us in my flat
I can't forget what I read""

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think, I think the lines are starting to get blurry

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battle sucka-duck, crawl out the back, it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up to court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like ""That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you ""au jus""
'Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you.""
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic K-Mart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
(rape your mother, kill your parents)

Shit, motherfucker, and these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming ""fuck, shit, fuck""
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like ""merits, fuck that""
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like ""tight lyrics, dreamy eyes""
But my fucking mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
(ha ha) Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

There's darkness closing in (evil twin)
There it goes again (my evil twin)
It controls my pen (my evil twin)
But that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (evil twin)
Who pops up now and again (again)
So don't blame me (evil twin)
Blame him, it's my evil twin
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh- Ledger
My suicide note's, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definitely my destiny
When on the steps I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes tryna get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming, ""Fuck the police!"" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck do you think that 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?
Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fucking chorus to ""Hip Hop Hooray""?
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom end like an 8-0-8
And I base whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in the bowling
You tryna hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch

Beyond that road lies a shining world.
Beyond that road lies despair.
Beyond that road lies a world that's gleaming.
People who are scheming.
Beauty!
Hunger!
Glory!
Sorrow!
Never a pain or care.
I'm liable to find a couple of surprises there.
There's a song he must sing;
It's a well-known song.
But the tune is bitter
And it doesn't take long to learn!

I can learn!
That pretty little world that beams so bright.
That pretty little world that seems delightful
Can burn!
Let me learn! Let me learn!

For, I can see it!
Shining somewhere!
Bright lights somewhere invite me to come there
And learn!
And I'm ready!

I can hear it!
Sirens singing!
Inside my ear I hear them all singing
Come learn!

Who knows, maybe
All the visions I can see
May be waiting just for me
To say take me there, and

Make me see it!
Make me feel it!
I know it's so
I know that it really
May be!

Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake,
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Night after night, Day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rising men
Just like you my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must to slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own.

How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been thru Hell, What good did it do?
You bastard! I'm supposed to respect you!
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtue first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own.

You get your lover in the bed
Come here I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I play in blood, but not my own.

Because we had to accept the wrongs
And try to make them right
Oh, oh, oh, you can
Look at yourself and see the truth
Realize it takes time to become you

Oh, just get to moving' on
We're moving on (keep on moving on)
We're moving on
Living day by day everything must change
But in a way it's gonna stay the same
Always, never gonna change, moving on

We know we've changed
But we're still the same
Getting closer to what we're supposed to be
As life goes on, you'll have your time
Because everything's meant to be
Oh, oh, oh, moving on
Moving on, moving on
Everything must change
But we're still the same, baby

Moving' on
We're moving on, we're moving on
Living day by day, everything must change
But in a way everything stays the same
(Stays the same)
Moving on, moving on

Moving on, moving on
Everything must change
But we're still the same

Like a siren in my head that always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver’s seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction
A premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny…I deny 

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow but I want the world to die

Like a release from prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed to leave 
From way back then
Like a general without a mission 
Until the war will start again…start again

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot 
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from heaven turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your life

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn't love you (Love you, love you)
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn't need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, ""Don't touch me"" (Touch me, touch me)
I lied, I lied

I can't fall for you, can't give my all to you
Can't let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, ""Let's see""
But I ain't mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won't let you break mine
'Cause I'll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? Who knows? So, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, ""Fuck you"" (Fuck you, fuck you)
I lied, I lied

I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn't real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic (Orgasmic)

I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you'd do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied

I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa

I lied, ooh, baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you (Ooh)
It's over now, goodbye, love (Ah, oh)
You'll stay, you'll stay in my heart (You'll stay in my heart) forever

What y'all wanna do?
Tell me

See, around here, we're just too much
We could slow down and you still couldn't catch us
My town full of heavy-hitters, bread-getters
Real fly, unforgettable-type niggas
See, all I do is keep hitting them up
Getting them up, shaking your butt, nigga, what
Lil Liberaci, can't nobody stop me
Always making moves, so you better watch me
Slide to the south side in my blue drop top, 355
Keeping it live
When you wanna make them jump, you know what to do
Call me and my crew to the rescue
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party 'til there's no one left
Turn your volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bomb, bump-bump-bump make your speakers pop

You never missed your water 'til your well runs dry
I never missed my woman 'til she said goodbye
Now my heart's made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready to give you what you deserved
Baby, baby, baby, please

Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl

The grass is greener on the other side
We take people for granted 'til they're out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you

All I do, is think of you
I can't eat, can't sleep, baby it ain't hard to see (all I do)

Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man
His enemies say he's on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to, no place to run
He's the neighborhood bully.

The neighborhood bully he just lives to survive
He's criticized and condemned for being alive
He's not supposed to fight back, he's supposed to have thick skin
He's supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
He's the neighborhood bully.

The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
He's wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
He's always on trial for just being born
He's the neighborhood bully.

Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
Old women condemned him, said he could apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad
He's the neighborhood bully.

Well, the chances are against it, and the odds are slim
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him
'Cause there's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a licence to kill him is given out to every maniac
He's the neighborhood bully.

Well, he got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for, he don't get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
He's the neighborhood bully.

Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now, they wouldn't hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
He's the neighborhood bully.
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody, under no one's command
He's the neighborhood bully.

Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract that he signed was worth that what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
He's the neighborhood bully.

What's anybody indebted to him for ?
Nothing, they say. He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
He's the neighborhood bully.

What has he done to wear so many scars ?
Does he change the course of rivers ? Does he pollute the moon and stars ?
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
Running out the clock, time standing still
Neighborhood bully.

I'm beginnin' to hear voices and there's no one around
I'm all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday as she passed by
And my love for her has taken such a long time to die
Well, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It's almost like, almost like, I don't exist
I'm twenty miles out of town, Cold Irons bound.

Well, the walls of pride are high and wide
Can't see over to the other side
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay
It's sadder still to feel your heart turn away
One look at you and I'm out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.

There's too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside mud
Up over my head, nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasn't proved true
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound
Twenty miles out of town, Cold Irons bound.

Well the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
Some kind of things you can never kill
Though it's you, and you only, I'm singin' about
But you can't see in and it's hard looking out
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.

Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I care
I'm gonna remember forever the joy we've shared
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee
You've no idea what you did to me
I'm twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound
Twenty miles out of town and Cold Irons bound.

Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love

From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain...

Lets talk about love
Lets talk about us
Lets talk about life
Lets talk about trust
Lets talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - 'til the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Lets talk about love - it's all were needin'
Lets talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'
Lets talk about life - I wanna know you
Lets talk about trust - and I wanna show you
Lets talk about love

In the days when the lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen.

And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried.

Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh

For the earth is old and grey, little darling wellaway
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand

I remember that my heart does ache

Oh, ayo, Dre
I'm discombobulated
Let's take 'em back (Accents)
In time (Everything's all fucked up)
I'm discombobulated, discombobulated
Miss, you ovulating? Wait, I didn't mean to
Piss you off, my lady, what I really meant to say is
It goes a little something like this

Soon as I'm through with the Unisom I'ma hit the snooze alarm
Before I lose my mind, who am I gonna use it on?
Utilizing this tool, I will execute a line
Like what I tried to do one time in my youth when I euthanized
My poodle in junior high, used to hide in my room and fly
To the moon and try suicide with the glue from my school supplies
Then Proof, Denaun
Eye-Kyu and I would climb in that hooptie to ride to Drew's and rhyme
Bodied Saint Andrew's Hall too many times to count
Before I tear up The Shelter, give my dawgs a pound
Now I'm 'bout to treat all of you rappers noggins how
Dre does every time he goes back to Compton now
'Cause every so often I'll visit my old stomping grounds
And Doc's in the house, so you know the bong is out
Room is spinning like nine-hundred-thousand miles an hour
Forgot what I'm talkin' 'bout, fuck, I'm discombobulated

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!), yeah

Just flew the coop, the cops are in hot pursuit
But the day they catch me is the day 50'll call a truce
And quash the feud with him and Ja and Ja'll actually spit a bar
That's not from a Dr. Seuss book and they'll start a group (Haha)
Fuck it, I'm a kook, I know I got a screw
And a couple of marbles loose, brain is like ramen soup
Shout to Trugoy, gotta give a De La salute
'Cause my noodle's in a knot, call it pasta noose (Yeah)
Wizard of ahs and oohs
Same Marshall Bruce in that battle who lost to Juice
Who also used to sound like Nas on ""Live at the Barbeque""
Now I got the juice, wouldn't beef if I was you
Like, au jus, but beef, if like
""I was you,"" but, like, ah, fuck you (Man)
Long as I got these walls and these hallways I'm always
Have someone to argue with, I'm just all twisted, I'm discombobulated, man

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no
So, baby, please, take off your clothes
(No!) Yes! (No!) Yes! (No!) No! (Yes!) Oh! (Oh!)

I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
And for that I'm blessed, so every time I rap I curse
And that's why press, I usually get attacked by first
They're at my neck like motherfucking vampires
So critics si-day I si-day the same shi-dit, I'm always degrading, little bi-ditch
Well, fi-duck 'em, they can si-duck my di-dick when I'm taking a shi-dit
Mid-y middle fid-inger is ex-tid-ended now, should I tell 'em where to put it?
I'm si-do fed up with it, they ask me dumb shi-dit
So I act like I'm on a kayak with my back to Niagara
No life jacket, man, I had like six psychiatrists, scientists
Misdiagnose me with plaque psoriasis 'cause I asked 'em, ""Why is it
My eye itches?"" so they gave me some diet tips
And Viagra with side effects, I might end up growing spiderwebs
In my head and dying a horrifying death, on my final breath
I will tell you, apply your lips to my dick, it's one size that fits
I just took an AIDS test and the doctor said to think positive, what the fuck?

Now up is down, left is right
Day is night now, in is out, black is white
So to-and-fro and side-to-side
Am I coming or going? Man, I can't decide
'Cause back is forth now and stop means go
No means yes, but yes don't mean no

Tell her that my ship set sail

Please, don't mention the stage coach
And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day.

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart is aching for Mary
Lord know I miss her so
Just tell her that I went to Timbukto
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold.

(I, I wanna grow up too)
""Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?""
Here we go!

Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
""Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash.""
""Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass.""
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the ""Mr
Not-Havin'-It,"" it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: ""Slim, you're really startin' to upset me.""
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
""We got a bogey,"" ""Marshall, I'm on the way.""

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
""Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!"" ""Let's Go!""
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
""What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri.""
""Fuck it,"" keep goin', no time to waste
""Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case.""
""Okay,"" fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
""Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!""
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
""He couldn't have fell off that hard."" Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
""What was that?"" ""Pet Shop Boys.""
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
""Compton!"" ""Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!""
""Stomp him!"" ""Switch feet!"" ""Stomp him!"" ""Switch again!""
""Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!"" (""Ahh!"")
""Damn,"" ""He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!""

Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who do they think could bury you?

With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who could they get to carry you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?

With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?

With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners, and your mother's drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do you think could resist you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Oh, the farmers and the businessmen they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?

They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever have persuaded you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?

Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion and your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul
Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

While all around me what do I see
Unhappy faces behind a painted smile
Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style
Unhappy people living in sin and shame
Reflections of myself, life is no easy game
And we're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Young girls who'll soon become
Streetwalkers in the night
Young boys, the restless breed
Looking for a fight
Children both rich and poor
They're searching for the truth
And if they don't find it
God help tomorrow's youth

The trade winds of our time

Trade winds are blowing, blowing around me
While all around me what do I see
Hatred and jealousy
Brotherhood is dying
Love is the answer
Nobody's buying
Good people turning bad
Some don't but they are few
The winds are blowing
The choice is all up to you
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

By a swamp in Alabama in the cold in the damp
Sittin reading by the light of a kerosene lamp
Lives a holly roller with a mission on her mind
Got to spread the word to anybody she can find
You can hear her screaming any time in night or day
This is what she says to keep the demons away

Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down
Steppin on the bus that was heading to town
There they started drinking, they got into a fight
The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night
When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail
This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail

Run devil run, the angels having fun

Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

[Lead solo (8 bars)]

[Piano (8 bars)]

Well by the middle of the summer they were back in the shack
Picking cotton for a livin keep 'em on the right track
Visiting the nieghbours trying to spread the good news
Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues
All of them determined to deliver the goods
Now you you hear the music comin out on the woods

Run devil run, the angel having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

Ah you'ld better Run . . . Run Devil Run
You better Run . . . Run Devil Run

Baby be polite
You're gonna make me sore
If you don't greet me right
Don't you ever kiss me once, kiss me twice
Treat me nice

It's not fair to tease
So if you come on cold
I'm really gonna freeze
If you don't want me to be cold as ice
Treat me nice

Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair

You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you
If you want my love then take my advice
Treat me nice

Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair

You know I'll be your slave

But if you don't behave

If you want my love then take my advice
Treat me nice

2986,Bob Dylan,,Hiding Too Long,,"

Come you phoney super patriotic people that say
That hatin' and fearing is my only way
That this here country has got to be
You're thinkin' of yourselves, you ain't thinkin' of me

You're not thinkin' of any George Washington
You're not thinkin' of any Thomas Jefferson
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead
You use their names for aims, for your selfish greed

Don't speak to me of your patriotism
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison
An' you say that the only good niggers are the ones that have died
Don't think I'll ever stand on your side

Though you make it so hard for me to love
My face will never feel the slap of your glove
My cards will never buy...
My hands will never buy the cards that you play
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay

Get out in the open, stop standin' afar
Let the whole world see what a hypocrite you are
I ain't jokin' and it ain't no gag
You bin hidin' too long behind the American flag

There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than I

The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

Please forgive this platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind,
Never could find
Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay
Give you your way
Do what you say
Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy,
When I've got you
Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has its funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get so blue
But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?

Ev'ry one keeps telling me I'm something I'm not
They fill me with questions, they tear me apart
But through it all it was you who pulled me out
Please don't leave me now
Just give me one more night to hold you, one more night
Give me one more night to have you near
There's a man at the train stop
With tears in his eyes
Reminds me of so long ago
When I was able to cry
Now I'm strong
Slip away and laugh along
With anyone who needs someone blue
Just give me one more night to hold you
One more night
Give me one more night to have you near
What can I say to make you stay?
I'd do anything; I' d give ev'rything
To have just one more night to hold you
One more night
Give me one,

Sing of the mountains and the deep dark sea
Sing of the lakes and the nymphs of the forest
Sing your hearts out, all your women of the chorus
Sing of honor and fate and glory be
Mother of Muses sing for me

Mother of Muses sing for my heart
Sing of a love too soon to depart
Sing of the heroes who stood alone
Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone
Who struggled with pain so the world could go free
Mother of Muses sing for me

Sing of Sherman, Montgomery and Scott‬
And of Zhukov, and Patton, and the battles they fought
Who cleared the path for Presley to sing
Who carved the path for Martin Luther King
Who did what they did and they went on their way
Man, I could tell their stories all day

I'm falling in love with Calliope
She don't belong to anyone, why not give her to me?
She's speaking to me, speaking with her eyes
I've grown so tired of chasing lies
Mother of Muses, wherever you are
I've already outlived my life by far

Mother of Muses, unleash your wrath
Things I can't see, they're blocking my path
Show me your wisdom, tell me my fate
Put me upright, make me walk straight
Forge my identity from the inside out
You know what I'm talking about

Take me to the river, release your charms
Let me lay down a while in your sweet, loving arms
Wake me, shake me, free me from sin
Make me invisible, like the wind
Got a mind to ramble, got a mind to roam
I'm travelin' light and I'm a-slow coming home

Broken like a crooked smile
A little hunched over but I walked that mile
I've woken from a fuzzy dream
You never would believe the things that I have seen

Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry
Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I won't change my story
Don't take all my glory
Don't you feel sorry for me

Tied up with leather and rope
A little bit of medicine to give me hope
I'm empty like a smoking gun
It's gonna take a while to heal the damage done

Don't you feel sorry for me
'Cause I'm right where the universe wants me to be
A lesson that I needed to learn (A lesson that I needed to learn)
But that doesn't mean that it doesn't burn

I want it—

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!

Hello, Charlie
Ariana, Normani, uh, let's go

Baby, I've been feeding the addiction
Flying from there and back
Felt like an acrobat
Brown eyed so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself
Like ""What the hell?""

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're stepping up, stepping up, huh huh

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
(Tell me why) Are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)

Stopped thinking like a victim
This time I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention
That's when I figured out
What you're about

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're stepping up, stepping up, huh huh

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
(Tell me why) Are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)

Why you only nice when I get bad, boy, psha
Get back on your job like you employed, boy, psha
You know that I'm saucy, got that sauce, soy, psha
I ain't 'bout to stay up on this merry-go-round around
'Cause we go 'round and 'round
But I don't want no clowns around me
I tell him ""Who is you cuffin'?""
I got him huffin' and puffin'
He keep on callin' me ""baby""
Like I'm a bun in the oven
I said

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
(Tell me why) Are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you? (Why are you only)

Yo, yo, yo
This your man Royce Da 5'9""
This your dude Crooked I
Man, Jump off Joe Beezy
It's Joell Ortiz

[Hook - Joell Ortiz:]
Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse

[Verse 1 - Joell Ortiz:]
Little niggas get your weight up fuck y'all, pay up
My bars just as slick as my dick and both stay up
Nicer than me, say what? Wait up, straight up
I finish niggas right off the bat like a layup
I seen a lot of come, I seen a lot of go
But y'all know where I'm from, B-R double O
You know the rest pimpin', yeah, I was bred different
Here come pops with the NY bop, you know, the leg limpin'
My ice mug frozen till it's stiff
Grimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch
I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women
Let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em
I might just throw 'em a gold fronts
Pour up a cup of E & J and light up a dro blunt
I was never soft, never saw me flinchin' when they lettin' off
Never had to retaliate cause I set it off

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Royce Da 5'9"":]
Ya'll know my name, bitch, never change up my language
I'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt
First we take oath
Then I'm pulling turquoise strings in my Lebron corks In Turks and Caicos
I came from wicked chair fame wearin' short sets
I learned that money can't buy happiness
But I decided I'd rather do all my cryin' in the Corvette
Make a dollar, buy a suit
Have a child, and have 'em follow suit
Wavin' that weatherchange things
Make the winter fall, coming through with everything to lose
Taking everything from you know
Let him finish his fall in his draws
And pray that he land on that minute hand in my Hublot
I'm about that Art Of War gospel
That Basquiat Picasso drawing a roscoe
Using the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow
Your money on me, bet it all, you know I'mma set it off

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden:]
Let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth
Truth is I give a fuck, but it's right to myself
Fuck fame, keep the shit I write to myself
If what I do is therapeutic, man, the slightest shit helps
Made angel dust my freshman year
Gave it a try, cool, little did I knew
Had the wrong meaning of high school
Teachers called him a sociopath and a liar
Fuck them, only went to class for the cyphers
Now I'm gettin' bills for
The same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for
They said I needed a wrench, I'm a loose screw
Vital, suicidal, said I would kill mi amour
Wasn't speakin' in French, said I'd let it off
Never know who or what you might get
Main reason they never want me to set it off
You now dealing with four niggas that's never off
All bets off, so nah, you won't be better off

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Crooked I:]
Jewish tats arm on my arm like a Semitic boss
Egyptian art hanging, uh, that's my Kemetic cross
Slaughterhouse set it off
Even got bitches wavin' our flag, Betsy Ross
Old school Chevy, the head is off
Decapitated Impala
Heavy lack from the weight of the llama
Still bear arms like a shaven koala
How you thinkin' like a faded neurology student
Is prudent when chasin' a dollar
So never mind, a clever rhyme
I'd rather find a better grind, forever times
Sittin' behind me because I'm ahead of mine
In this era I'm livin' outside of the paradigm
I'm comin' outside with a pair of dimes
Sharon and Caroline
Share a line then they share a 9 inch, never mind
I probably shouldn't even keep going
Cause these rappers keep hoein' with their teeth showing
I set it off

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you riding sixteen hours there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant, all strung-out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode

And most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old clichés, ""Is it woman? Is it man?""
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page

Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play

Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
What she said

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page

There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go
There I go
And I'm gone

There will be times
When you and I may come together
Somewhere in some crowded room
I know we will
And all my feelings show

Can this be love to me, some destiny
'Cause that's what gets you high
Could we unite, late at night?
It's all so lonely
If only you were mine

Life has a way of changing all your plans
Without you understanding
What if I could choose the games that we could play
Baby it's not too late
Don't make me wait

If only you were mine

I want my life to be
Just you and me
To have your love
To be the first in line

Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day
Shape shift, hair stands on the back of my neck
Shape shift, in wildness is the preservation of the world 
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I have been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of wolf and man

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfucking life
Oh shit, the shooter's comin'
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door

This chick is clinging on to me sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she's yelling
(Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late

Sleeping outside the door waiting in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
And some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall
Now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my God it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee
Follow Bizarre's path ran through it
Made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four-fifth

Big ass in my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right

Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender

And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I can turn away
And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

"
1171,Avril Lavigne,,You Were Mine,,"

I can't find a reason to let go 
Even though you've found a new love 
And she's what your dreams are made of 
I can find a reason to hang on 
What went wrong can be forgiven 
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone 

Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine 

I took out all the pictures of our wedding day 
It was a time of love and laughter 
Happy ever after 
But even those old pictures have begun to fade 
Please tell me she's not real 
And that you're really coming home to stay 

Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine 

I can give you two good reasons 
To show you love's not blind 
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you 
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind 

Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine 
I remember when you were mine

Hello
Allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
It's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you

You see that chick in the gym checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout
To stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wrecking the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?

There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yeah, 'Open Sesame' mouth

Down the hatch and the feeling you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like 40-some Xanaxes

Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 40-40 and 40s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch I'm back at you

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say ""hello""
And are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say ""hello""
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty's shaking like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say ""hello""

My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extra-curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun

A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun? But what is your name? Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?

Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from

I find the package and I'm cool,
I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes,
I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say ""hello""
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say ""hello""

Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word
I second that and I third,
Rush to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased

He's no longer getting them free
Hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him

Tirelessly on the phone tryna rustle up muscle relaxers
For his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack

Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved so fuck it, I'm back

Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say ""hello""
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,
Some are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say ""hello""

And so I'm saying,

Hello allow me to introduce myself
My name is Shady
So nice to meet you
It's been a long time
I'm sorry I've been away so long
My name is Shady
I never meant to leave you

It's like starting over
Clean slate

Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Cos my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee

The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her

Out there
There's a world outside of Yonkers
Way out there beyond this hick town, Barnaby
There's a slick town, Barnaby
Out there
Full of shine and full of sparkle
Close your eyes and see it glisten, Barnaby
Listen, Barnaby...
Put on your Sunday clothes
There's lots of world out there
Get out the brillantine and dime cigars
We're gonna find adventure in the evening air
Girls in white in a perfumed night
Where the lights are bright as the stars!
Put on your Sunday clothes, we're gonna ride through town
In one of those new horsedrawn open cars

[Cornelius & Barnaby:]
We'll see the shows at Delmonicos
And we'll close the town in a whirl
And we won't come until we've kissed a girl!

Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about
That Sunday shine is a certain sign
That you feel as fine as you look!

[Dolly & Ambrose:]
Beneath your parasol, the world is all a smile
That makes you feel brand new down to your toes

[Dolly, Ambrose, Cornelius, & Barnaby:]
Get out your feathers, your patent leathers
Your beads and buckles and bows
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday...
No Monday in your Sunday...
No Monday in your Sunday clothes!

Put on your Sunday clothes when you feel down and out
Strut down the street and have your picture took

Strut down the street and have your picture took

That you feel as fine as you look!
Beneath your bowler brim the world's a simple song
A lovely lilt that makes you tilt your nose
Get out your slickers, your flannel knickers
Your red suspenders and hose
For there's no blue Monday in your Sunday clothes!

Where the girls are hot as a fuse!

Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands

Try me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can ever repay, all I've taken from You
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to You

2573,Bob Dylan,1965.0,Gates Of Eden,"""Bringing It All Back Home""","

Of war and peace the truth just twists
Its curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattered sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom 'cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

[Eminem and Sia:]
I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause

[Sia:]
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Eminem:]
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed
So focused on the bright side
Then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast the more asserted
Never looking back
May hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to
To avert a disaster
Lucky no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant

[Sia:]
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Eminem:]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
'Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep 'cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
'Cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

As time passes
Things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same
But tomorrow today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
From the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

[Sia:]
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Her hair is soft and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be,
But she's not you.

She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want,
But she's not you.

And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from
Whispering your name

She even kisses me like you used to do.
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you.

And it's just breaking my heart

(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like the Komodo Dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
(Your music usually has them)
(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)
(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on (oh..)
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
(It says) Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to die hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, I don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand, to promised land, and threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

Nah, (What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha ha
(Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)
No

If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, to be rapping
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department
With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent, and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor, I must plead
Guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip-hop is the devil's music) Does it mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
'Cause it's the…

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan, my job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)

So yeah dad let's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of life
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
It's hysterical, I chuckle
'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle heads
The sign on my hustle says ""Don't knock""
The door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead Rainman
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef
'Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
I still am a criminal
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to send
Is ""Dad, I'm back at it again.""
Bitch (who's your daddy?)

[SHANTY]
And so it was that I had grown
Into a youth uncertain, thrown
Amongst the lions and the lambs.
To pass the time we watched the children dance.

I used to come here when this place was a crypt.
Now the music plays.
Oh don't you sometimes wish they'd stick to the script
As the local preacher says.

Rain from heaven will blessings bring,
Behold the harvest grown. R
Ian from heaven falls down on you,
But me, I feel alone.

[PREACHER (sympathetically)]
Alone.

[SHANTY]
Alone.

[PREACHER]
If they won't come to worship
God in a church
Something must be done.
We have to instigate a nationwide search
For a way to make it fun.
Rain from heaven will blessings bring,
Behold the harvest grown.

[SHANTY and PREACHER]
Rain from heaven falls down on you,

But me, I feel alone.
Alone.

Here now,
What am I doing here now?
Hear me,
Why do you never hear me?
Why do you never hear me?

[MARY DEE (as half-ghost)]
I'll always be here.
I'll never leave you.
I'll always be in your mind.
Dreams of the future,
Ghosts of the past left behind.

[WOMEN'S CHORUS]
(Ah)

[SHANTY]
Thought I had a vision
Lying in a graveyard,
Thought I heard a melody inside.
Could it be the future,
Speaking with the voice of those who died?

Thought I saw a kingdom,
Happiness and laughter,
Somewhere for an innocent to play.
Is there any justice?
Do these things still happen in this way?

[MARY DEE]
Don't tell him no,
It isn't fair.
For he was told by those who know
There was love everywhere.

[SHANTY]
Love everywhere.

[MARY DEE]
Now's the time to tell him,
While his mother's crying.
Break it to him gently as she weeps.
Let him know his father
Will be well looked after, where he sleeps.

[CHORUS (ghosts)]
He's sleeping amongst us.
He's in our dreams.
Don't worry. he's with us now.

Don't say it's so,

If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you're counting on me to come through
You should know that I'll give you the best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do

If you're walking beside me
And you wanna be friends
You should know I'm depending on you
So you gotta hang in there till the whole story ends
Cause we all have a little more homework to do

I've been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime
But I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet
There are too many answers that I didn't get
I need a little less pressure and a little more time

I'm trying to follow
I'm trying to lead
I'm trying to find what is true
But if you're gonna stand with me
Then you have to concede
That we all have a little more homework to do

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
You get a little bit older
A little bit taller
A little bit better
A little bit

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the days before all go too fast
You can't hold on
So, you go

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
I'm a little bit older
A little bit stronger
A little bit smarter

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the days ahead coming on so quick
You can't get out of the way
You keep running

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And I'm a little bit older
A little bit faster
A little bit closer
A little bit

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the sky goes blue
And the sky goes black
And no matter what you do
You can't go back

You go day into day, into day
Day into day, into day
Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day

And I've been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime
And I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet
There are too many answers that I didn't get
I need a little less pressure
And a little more time

I'm trying to follow, I am trying to lead
I am trying to learn what is true
I am trying to be what you want and I need, and we all have

2966,Bob Dylan,,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,,"

He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place

And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye

When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now
What happened?
What do I remind you of?
Your past? Your dreams?
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Tell me why 'cause you're gonna have to justify

Well I'm stacking up skirts and things
Packing up and fixing to go
For some little reason that I can't remember
And this leaving is a-grieving me so
But just one little kiss
Could put all of this leaving behind
Yeah, baby me baby
And maybe I might change my mind
Baby me baby
Everyday
Baby me baby
And make all my blues go away
Baby me baby
Everyday
Baby me baby
And I'll baby you the same way
Sometimes the times are good times
And sometimes the times
Are not quite so good as the good times should be
And that's when leaving starts to enter my mind
But just one word from you
And I'd put all of my suitcases down
Yeah, baby me, baby
And maybe I might stick around

And make all my blues go away
Baby me baby

And it's about time

And repeating the process

Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice

Miss you most of all
When all those autumn leaves start to fall
Drifting by my window
They come up over the wall

Why does a good thing have to do end
Can't see it happen where and when
Cycle of change can be so cruel
I've got no one to blame I'm just a fool, you know

Hold on they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

Miss you most of all
When they burn those bonfires tall
Smoke and ashes fill the air and the
Harvesters are everywhere
No time to waste, let's drink the wine
Don't let the fruit rot on the vine
When the sun is big and fiery it goes, you know
That is the time I miss you the most, they say

Hold on they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

Cold wind is howling and there's
Dampness creeps﻿ in our bones
Seasons change, why didn't we
Come on bring that summer back to me

Hold on they keep on telling me
Something good is gonna come
The red and gold has put its spell on﻿ me
And old man winter's gonna come
You know he keeps on blocking off the sun

Tell me why does he always have to come?

Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much
Sweet sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
So give it away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love
A boom-a-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing

Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang

Tasting the air you're breathing in

Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same

All of the hopes we cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my 9-to-5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder

Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat

Touch him
With the gentleness you feel inside
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's mean to be 
All in time you'll see

I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

I'll

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to go

Never let him go

He was the sultan of Samarcand
He had a harem of dancing girls at his command
He owned all the eye could see
Something was wrong, he wasn't happy

And then it happened much to his surprise
The loveliest woman he'd ever seen
He asked her name and she replied
[Madonna:] Scheherazade

She was the daughter of the grand vizier
A real beauty with a heart of gold, she was so sincere
She made a date with destiny
Marry the king, make him happy

He was enchanted on their wedding night
Just a captive under her spell
Spending a thousand and one Arabian nights
[Madonna:] Scheherazade

All of his body tingled with delight
Hearing the stories she loved to tell
She was a vision, such a lovely sight
[Madonna:] Scheherazade

He made a promise on the morning star
He would change, throw away his scimitar
So she came to stay
And that's the way the story goes
Until this very day

Spending a thousand and one Arabian nights

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Everybody knows:
One day we love each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time.

When I was young and just getting started,
And people talked to me: they sounded broken hearted.
Then I grew up and got my imagination,
And all I wanted was to start a new relation.

So in love, but love had a bad reaction.
I was looking for some good old satisfaction,
But pain is all I got
When all I needed was some love and affection.

Pain is so close to pleasure.
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life.

Pain and pleasure.
Pain and pleasure.

When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light,
But inside of your mind you put up a fight.

Where are the answers that we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore.
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad,
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad.

Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face
For better, for worse.
So let's make the best of the rest of our years.

The trucks and the trailers will be winding
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling

As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

It's a-many a friend that follows the bend
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents
Get that canvas flag a-flying
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the Ferris wheel wind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds
Just behind the posters that are hanging
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind
Hear that old music box a-banging
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling

It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town
Hit the old highway by the morning
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime
Drinking red wine as we're rolling
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn
From following them fairgrounds a-calling

And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em
And the money that we made will pay for the space
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!

Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble

Give her another chance? Another one after that?

Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eating grin when I smile
Making an excuse for us to act it out

And bad? I'm starting to feel like your goddamn dad

Leave you for good and never would I

Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fucking back on you—what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticing it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it

In fact she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all
She will understand me

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear
Of those things
But when I'm asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
I'll get away with it

Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
Cos we love you, Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
Cos we love you, Mr. Moonlight

And the night you don't come my way
Oh, I'll pray and pray more each day
Cos we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
Cos we love you, Mr. Moonlight

Girl it's getting late
And everything's closing down, where are you now?
You know I need my medicine
I'm sick when you ain't around, you keep me alive

My heart's racing 'til I hear from you
And I don't know what to do
I'm almost home halfway 'cross town
But I'll turn back around
If you need me to, I'll come get you
If you don't wanna drive
And that I'll leave the door open
Just come inside

All night long
(It's just me and you, girl)
Take our time, we gon' be all night
We go, all night long
(Now we ain't gotta rush)
Take our time, we can go all night

I waited all night long
And I can't wait to kiss you
Feel you up all over, my body misses you
Waited all night long to hear you moan
Baby bring it on
Waited all night long
Waited all night long for your love

I'm so glad you're here and taking off your clothes
Take it off slow
Lay your precious body down right here beside me, girl
I wanna play

I'm all wrapped up in pleasing you
There's nothing I won't do
If it keeps you satisfied, I'll try
At least a time or two
You're the only one that keeps me coming
Coming back for more
There's just something about your loving
I love to explore

All night long
(It's just me and you, girl)
Take our time, we gon' be all night
(All night, all night)
We go, all night long
(Now we ain't gotta rush, no)
Take our time, we can go all night (woo!)

I waited all night long
And I can't wait to kiss you
Feel you up all over, my body misses you
Waited all night long to hear you moan
Baby bring it on
Waited all night long
Waited all night long for your love

All night long
(It's just me and you, girl)
Take our time, we gon' be all night
We go, all night long
(Now we ain't gotta rush)
Take our time, we can go all night

Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up
Cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food?
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her
And she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty and lastly

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

And we’ve got that love in us
So if the drink kill us
We’re gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
Say I hate wasps too
I don’t really dance
So I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here
I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you’re wearing

And I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone, oh.

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

She’s like the fast food
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

Now tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

I had a mil before the label

Start the engine watch me take off, money made me do it

Hit the gas melt your face off
Spend the day counting cake up
With a dime who think I changed up

Ran through it like some Drain-o

Shawty fucked my friend but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a rain coat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus

Smoking on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

Half a breath left on my deathbed

Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off

Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast

Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp

I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do

Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me ""Doody""?

You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards

Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination - that is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of his hand is incredible
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
""Keep a look out""
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind you and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, the trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

In the hood daylight to night and you can find me grindin’ daily
And it ain’t gon’ change as long as we getting money keep the same mind frame
Same hood, betta pop that thang, same big whip on the block same fly dame
Wit my lady just rollin’, with the sunshine and the wind blowin’

[Intro - Big Meech]
This Big Meech from the richest black muthafucking gang in the world
My nigga always say, there’s only two things a nigga can do for you
You either got time or money, can’t have em both
Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money
We don’t have a lot of time around here – cause time is money

[Verse 1 - Akon]
Give me one minute, cause you tripping
Too much time on your hands, you slipping
Why you focused on all this dealing?
When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?
Crib on the hill: now that’s good living
Harder to reach when you make your first million
So much money gotta stack to the ceiling
And I’mma keep doing this forever, God-willing
Real niggas like me don’t catch feelings
Only broke niggas be out there grilling
Say you getting money but you ain’t even tipping
A big-booty girl in front of you dipping
Fronting like you really doing all that shipping
Man you gotta be, gotta be kidding
Don’t even try cause my weapon is hidden
My nigga is ready to do some killing

[Hook - Akon]
I’mma tell you just one time: give me what’s mine
Cause I don’t have time to waste
I’ll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I won’t stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don’t know if you really got what it takes
Hustling’s in my blood and it just won’t go away
Time, money, time, money

Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money

[Verse 2 - Akon]
‘Kon live in one year, made millions
Everybody got money: nigga, we chillin
Ain’t got no time: it’s some bad feelings
Especially when you want a little sexual healing
Girlfriend’s pulling, family’s pulling
In every direction, everybody need money
My lifestyle redefine how they all living
If I keep it up I’ll be broke in a minute
My kinfolk’s on the block and they dealing
All my goons are still out there killing
Man I be running, got no time to be skipping
Trying to hit a home run in the 9th inning
Meech locked up, copped out, for a killing
Taking care of mine, San Quen chilling
That’s my homie, you can trust that nigga
Just a matter of time before I get back with him

[Hook - Akon]
I’mma tell you just one time: give me what’s mine
Cause I don’t have time to waste
I’ll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I don’t stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don’t really know if you really got what it takes
Hustling’s in my blood and it just won’t go away
Time, money, time, money

Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money

[Verse 3 - Akon]
Gotta look out for haters if you wanna be blockin’
Look out for stick up kids that be robbin’
Look out for ladies with their hands in your pocket
If you don’t, you’ll be the next hot topic
Don’t wanna be the next one dropping
6 feet deep like conans coffin
I’d rather see you out there flossing
Love to see another brother getting it poppin
Chase that paper, don’t you wait up
Get your money nigga, fuck them haters
Everybody complain about your time
You ain't got none? Find a way to make it up later
Cause I ain't got time for all that
And you ain't got time for all that
And I don’t wanna waste your time
On behalf of BMF bring Meech back!

Time is money, time is money
Time is money, time is money
Time money, time money
time is money
Time money, time money

Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money
Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money

Oh no!
What's happening to my brain?
I can't believe this is happening
Again!

Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, I need another mask
I'd ask my mother, but I think she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers and some Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra, motherfucker, look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit, I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off when I pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
'Cause I react like the She-Hulk when I see NyQuil

Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (Don't know)
When it's going to end (When will it stop?)
Uh oh! (Uh oh!)
Where did it begin? (When did it begin?)
So long ago (So long ago)
Maybe way back when (Maybe way back when) (Relapse!)

Into the well, baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau was sending me letters from jail
Every day in journals, saying how she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor, shove a typewriter up Per-
-ez Hilton's ass, shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass, so why not that?
And fuck it, while I'm venting, let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end when he's bending over, pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending in G
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where... wait, I think the cupboard's bare
Stuff him up in the Tupperware and shove him up in there

Oh no! (Oh no!)
Here we go again (again)
Don't know (Don't know)
When it's going to end (When will it stop?)
Uh oh! (Uh oh!)
Where did it begin? (When did it begin?)
So long ago (So long ago)
Maybe way back when (Maybe way back when) (Relapse!)

Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who'm I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her then dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write this, just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man, I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hypertension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you for you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

Oh no! (Oh no!)

Well, it's time they knew

With on look
I can break your heart
With one look

I can make your sad heart sing
With one look you'll know
All you need to know

With one smile

Or the love that you've hungered for
When I speak it's with my soul
I can play any role

No words can tell
The stories my eyes tell
Watch me when I frown
You can't write that down
You know I'm right
It's there in black and white
When I look your way
You'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look

Just one look
Sets the screen aflame
Silent music starts to play
One tear from my eye
Makes the whole world cry

With one look
They'll forgive the past
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last
To my people in the dark
Still out there in the dark

Silent music starts to play

Oh, my goodness
What have I done
Oh no
I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector
Homosexual dissector
Come again rewind selector

I said nice rectum
I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya in less than five seconds I get ya

They say once bitten and twice shy
Well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities
Why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser

That's my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess I'll dig her fetus out
With a wire hanger then digest her

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends

All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up

Man you seen it all before you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kidding?

I'll pee on Rihanna
See man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room
Crazy-gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa
Fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that man

Who would've thought I could ever be such a relentless prick
Unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old
She looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive
It wouldn't be
You're so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball you're in my medicine ball friends

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here you need a hand, big man, grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man

Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words
Jeeze
So one last time, Mister Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please

Eminem I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes
My Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you they don't feel you

You're taking this shit too far
Who d'you think you are?
Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break-dance if you think you're hardcore

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball you're all in

Played it so nonchalant

[She joins a group of students on their way
To a Yeshiva in Bechv where she is tested
By the Rabbi. He is impressed with Yentl's
Knowledge and admits ""him"" as a student.]

There are moments you remember all your life.
There are moments you wait for and dream,
Of all your life.
This is one of those moments.
I will always remember this chair,
That window, the way the light streams in.
The clothes I'm wearing,
The words I'm hearing,
The face I'm seeing,
The feeling I'm feeling,
The smell, the sounds, will be written
On my mind, will be written in my heart
As long as I live!
I can, travel the past and take what I need
To see me through the years
What my father learned and his
Father before him will be there
For my eyes and ears.
I can walk through the forests
Of the trees of knowledge
And listen to the lessons of the leaves.
I can enter rooms
Were there are rooms within rooms
Wrapped in the shawl that learning weaves.
I remember, Papa-everything you taught me
What you gave me, Papa-
Look at what it's brought me
There are certain things that once you have
No man can take away-
No wave can wash away-
No wind can blow away-
And now they're about to be mine!
No tide can turn away-
No fire can burn away-
No time can wear away...
I can open doors and take from the shelves
All the books I've longed to hold
I can ask all the questions,
The whys and the wheres
As the mysteries of life unfold
Like a link in a chain
From the past to the future
That joins me with the children yet to be,
I can now be a part
Of the ongoing stream,
That has always been a part of me!
There are certain things that once you have
No man can take away-
No wave can wash away-
No wind can blow away-
No tide can turn away-
No fire can burn away-
No time can wear away-
And now they're about to be mine!
There are moments you remember all your life.
There are moments you wait for
And dream, of all your life.
This is one of those moments!

The moment I saw him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
For I dream of him all the while
But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see
There's no hope for me
Though I Iive at 5135, Kinsington Avenue
And he lives at 5133...
How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never seize me glance his way
And though I'm heart-soured
The little boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door...

How will I fall asleep tonight?
How will I rest my head?

And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed

And there's a ghost on the horizon

Oh! Oh! ...

Oh I'm scared of that middle place
Between light and nowhere
I don't want to be the one
Left in there, left in there

Wish that I'd go to bed
And if I fall to his feet tonight
Will allow rest my head

Nobody wants to see it
They don't even wanna try
Judge a book by its cover
And you'll never know the story
There's so much more than meets the eye

Oh and I know his heart is true

To tell me what to do

Tell me I should find another
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

Oh but they can't feel his touch
They can't feel his kiss
They don't know what it's like to be loved like this
I don't care about their point of view
'Cause it's understood
When the love is good
Nothin' else is gonna do

They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive 
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun

Well they look so pretty as they march and drill 
It's such, a pity that they're dressed to kill 
Soldiers marching two by two 
When it all comes down they know exactly what to do 

Here come the... war 

Warboys, warboys, children and their toys 
Warboys, warboys, make lot a noise 
Warboys, when the lightning exlpodes 
I pray for your soul 

Hup...2...3...4 

Well they look so fierce they're gonna tear out your heart 
When they get near we're gonna see what they got 
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine 
I'll see you in hell, some other time

Helping to kill, those who deserve to die 
Tell me who decides 
You and I 
We have the power

Young rich nigga, I am authentic

Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)

""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*slurp*]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*ewww!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""

And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...

[Rihanna - Chorus:]
Listen Gone Again
Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Listen Gone Again
Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
[Repeat]

[Jay-Z - Verse 2:]
They say ""they never really miss you til you dead or you gone""
So on that note I'm leaving after the song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
Atleast let me tell you why I'm this way, Hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees
Who made love under the Siccamore tree 
Which makes me
A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare
I made it from birth and I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose
I ain't perfect I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear
Now I'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school got good grades could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on

[Rihanna - Chorus:]
Listen Gone Again
Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Listen Gone Again
Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
[Repeat]

[Eminem - Verse 3:]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

[Rihanna - Chorus:]
Listen Gone Again
Story of my life
Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Listen Gone Again
Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

655,Alec Benjamin,,The Colonel's Journal (Demo),,"

The old colonel was a veteran
Each night he'd take his medicine
And stay up watchin' Letterman
Trying to forget
The things he saw when he was young
The carnage and the sound of guns
He kept his pain from everyone
With the ink inside his pen

The colonel kept a journal of his troubles and regrets
His battles were internal, raging wars inside his head
'Til the end, he was a soldier
'Cause the fight was never over
The colonel kept a journal and he left it in a box
Buried in the basement underneath some dirty socks
'Til the end, he was a soldier
'Cause the fight was never over

And the day he died, his kids flew in
Took some time just to remember him
They cleaned up his old medicine
As everybody wept
They were packing up the cellar
When they found his diary, read it and
Couldn't believe the things he said
With the ink inside his pen

The colonel kept a journal of his troubles and regrets
His battles were internal, raging wars inside his head
'Til the end, he was a soldier
'Cause the fight was never over
The colonel kept a journal and he left it in a box
Buried in the basement underneath some dirty socks
'Til the end, he was a soldier
'Cause the fight was never over

Mmmm-mmm
Mmmm-mmm

The old colonel was a veteran
My granddad, and a gentleman
I'll always remember him
Oh, I swear I won't forget
The things he saw when he was young
The carnage and the sound of guns
And the pain he kept from everyone
With the ink inside his pen

The colonel kept a journal of his troubles and regrets
His battles were internal, raging wars inside his head
'Til the end, he was a soldier

Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!)
It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)

""Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who."" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though!""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [*slurp*]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*ewww!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!""

Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*err*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*hach*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flame
Rather than running away

[Bridge:]
As it's winding down to zero
I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through 
There's so much me and you
Take this enemy together 
Fight these demons off forever
Forever forever forever

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call, I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

[2nd Bridge:]
Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossin' and turnin', you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call, I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all


[Chorus:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
I won't stop until it's done 
No curtain call, I will not fall 
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

632,Alec Benjamin,,I Built A Friend,,"

I built a friend with three pieces of plastic and a pen
I made him on the table in the den
I gave him my old cell phone for a head, for a head
And we spent holidays at my house
And we left presents in a stocking
And we bought bolts and things and strings
And a new watch, that's what he got

And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

Then I left for college in September
And we wept cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best

And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

I came home to find him on the table
With a note, scribbled out in pencil
And he wrote, that he just wasn't stable all alone, all alone
Next to him, an empty glass of water
That he spilled, all over the body
That I built, it fizzled and it popped
And then it killed, and then it killed

And we had so much fun together
We thought we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

I built a friend

Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love

From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain...

Lets talk about love
Lets talk about us
Lets talk about life
Lets talk about trust
Lets talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - 'til the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Lets talk about love - it's all were needin'
Lets talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'
Lets talk about life - I wanna know you
Lets talk about trust - and I wanna show you
Lets talk about love

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,
Left my mama a goodbye note,
By sundown I'd left Kingston,
With my guitar under my coat,
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,
Got a room at the YMCA,
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,
Just lookin' for a place to play,
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,
I run outta money and luck,
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,
On a overloaded poultry truck,
I thumbed on down to Panama City,
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,
Makin' music on my guitar,
I got the same old story at them all night piers,
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles,
Roamed a thousand miles of track,
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,
At a club they call Big Jack's,
A little four-piece band was jammin',
So I took my guitar and I sat in,
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,
With a swingin' little guitar man.
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
Find yourself down around Mobile,
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,
If you got a little time to kill,
Just follow that crowd of people,
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.

[The TV-special verse:]
Well, I came a long way from the carwash,
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really ain't  got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm gonna get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I' m a swinging little Guitar man

One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too

Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend and our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again?
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you, or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give?

Yeah, I bought me an illusion and I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams and I had to have them all
But, oh, the taste is never so sweet as what you'd believe it is
Well, I guess it never is, it's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood to the heart of the biz

You know, I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me, but I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my song
So now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems, somehow, I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you, or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive? Yeah, yeah

Sweetness is a virtue and you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you but my conscience always tells me ""No""
You could sell your body on the street to anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside and bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no

Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour 'cause this road ain't getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
""Better tame that boy, 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man""
Sweetheart, don't make me laugh, you's getting too big for your pants
And I think maybe you should cut out while you can

You can use your illusion, let it take you where it may
We live and learn, and then, sometimes, it's best to walk away
Me, I'm just here hanging on, it's my only place to stay
At least for now, anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions just to throw them all away

I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy, so why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say?
Callin' off the dogs, a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you, I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page?

Kindness is a treasure and it's one, towards me, you've seldom shown
So, I'll say it, for good measure, to all the ones like you, I've known
Ya know I'd like to shave your head and all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me is a two-way street, an' all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no

Affection is a blessing, can you find it in your sordid heart?
I tried to keep this thing together but the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah, I know, it's hard to face when all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman and I'm such a stupid man
But love, like time, 's got its own plans

But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no
Yeah, if love is blind, I guess I'll buy myself a cane

Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange

2944,Bob Dylan,2017.0,Stardust,"""Triplicate""","

Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend my lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall, when stars were bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale told his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart, it will always remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

To cry over you

I love only one girl, one in every town

In Paris there is Mimi, and when the moon is bright
I love to take her walking, along the Seine each night
I kiss her on the left, then I kiss her on the right

Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town

I'm proud of my Brunhilda, in Frankfurt on the Rhine
Oh she's a lot of woman and all of her is mine
Oh she can lift a Steinway as easy as a stein

Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town

In Naples there's Maria how she can cook and flirt
You can't beat her lasagna, I eat until I hurt
And then she tops it off with ""amore"" for dessert

I love only one girl, one in every town

And you're starting to get on my nerves
This is exactly what happened last time
And it's not what we deserve
It's a a waste of my time lately
And I'm running out of words

If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see

And maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby 'cause this is love
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

Love, love, love

It's really great to be with you
This is how I could spend my life
But I'm capable of taking care of myself
So if you fuck this up then go take a hike
It's a waste of my time shaking
I'm not going out to search

If it's really meant to be

Automatically had to be
carryin automatics sprayin sparatic inaccuarate
Clips to the back of it
barrel cockin it immaculate
Learn to move packages in n out of los angeles
We savages, bustin off rounds
sprayin bannana clips
knockin pills off like Anna Nicole Smith
Shit, I’m in the hood walkin with choppers
Cock em and pop em coppers glauks be talkin like…
blockedie block, block I’ll probly popped hoffa and possibly jus forgot where I tossed em
this niggas obnoxious, me and top got your picture in the cockpit
she wanna pitstop, jus see how the cock spit
these boss’s deposit the profit they watch as we cop it
on top of the ostrich and fox’s
It use to be the lil guys in stress now ima boss where i’m from,
with the last stress on my chest

[Chorus:]
See I know you’ll like my swagger
No strap when i come through
Chain hangin like Ali Baba
Know me, yah Know how I Do
The way that i move nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
Cause i’m to smooth Nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
I thought you knew nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
You aint got a clue Nigga (yah neva gonna get it)

Who in the hell left the gate open? (Drama)
I’m pretty down for the wild, wild west
Like them 1800’s in em stage coaches
If I aint strapped then my blaze pokin
If it aint a 600 big body then the 6 4-0 honey is spokin
The drama spokesman, streets endorsed em
I rather be up in my nine then closed in my coffin
I’m from Wes Covina, this aint Compton
Still money passed around like we takin an offerin

I’m somethin like a phenoneman
when they see the sad happy faces they know the drama is on
Its the west coast back at your front door
We up close and personal, we aint done till the curtains close
Could be friend or foe, love it or hate it
I’m the king but i play with the Aces
run up to find out i keep it loaded like bases
Ya got wires in ya mouth but these ain’t braces

[Chorus:]
See I know you’ll like my swagger
No strap when i come through

I wonderin why these fake Niggas Jackin me for?
On display like i came from the store
Posin like a manequin in front of your hoe
Up front block Rollin 50 deep now
Convicts Surround the whole compound
Cause you dont really want what your starin at
Clip full of Bullets, dont mind sharin that thing

How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, whatever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad

Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble!
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'

Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

Bagpipes from Baghdad

When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm o-over you
When you're leavin' is over and there's not another tear to cry
In the silence of that last goodbye just remember, remember this

When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.

Ooh-ooh-ooh
When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.

When I'm over you there'll be darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever shine again when I'm over, over you.

When I'm over you there'll be darkness, darkness, darkness where my soul has been
And no light will ever, ever shine again when I'm over you.

Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining
Tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Oh Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise

Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

First time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true

Must be beginner's luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are

I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
Must be beginner's luck
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves me

Two people
Like two children
We're holding back
We're holding on
Two children
Frightened of new places
Of getting lost
Of being found
Running, hiding
Somehow afraid of love
Playing in the sunlight
And shade of love
Games we play too well
Like two children
Isn't it time
Time we throw all our toys away
So that our love can grow
Day by day
We're two people trying to leave
What belongs to some far-off past
Ready to find the love that will last
Are you the one who can free
The child in me...

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane

Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright.
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Well, here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus Lane

He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above

I told you everything
You know my feelings
It never crossed my mind
That there would be a time
For us to say goodbye
What a big surprise

But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

I remember when it was together 'til the end
Now I'm alone again
Where do I begin?
I cried a little bit
You died a little bit
Please say there's no regrets
And say you won't forget

But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

If I didn't love you
I'd be safe from harm.
I would never find myself
Lost inside your arms.
If I didn't love you
I'd never feel the pain
Of sunny days without you
Drowning in the rain.
If I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you
Peace would rule the day
All the dark and out would surely go away.
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't pay the cost
Of living every endless day
If our love is lost.
If I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you...

And yet you make me breathless
At the way you move
I never knew that I
Could ever love the way we do.
I don't know how you reach me
In that place in my heart
Belonging to only you.

If I didn't love you
I wouldn't lose control
The danger loving brings a word
Never touch my soul.
If I didn't love you
Perhaps I wouldn't die.
If you should ever say to me
""I'm sorry, goodbye.""
If I didn't love you...
How can there be music
In the way you touch?
I can't believe that somehow
I believe in you so much.
Now you've come and taught me
How to give you my heart.
And make me feel at last
That the end will never start.
You're the only reason
I'm not afraid to fall.
For if I didn't love you...
If I didn't love you...
I wouldn't love at all.

But you might see me later alligator
In some Bally lace ups, with some jacket tapered
So much stones you thought it was animation
Wilma on my case cause all these chicks adjacent
To my table tryna drink my vodka and champagne up
I ain't no Matt Damon, but Bourne with Ultimatums
Get rich or die trying so we started cakin
I'm doing Kane but not the brother of Undertaker
And I ain't Muslim but tell my brothers Assalamu Alaykum
Finish Him! Kano my niggas no Raiden
Fuck with my darg then my nigga Alsatian

Ladies throwing me their clothes, then using their apocalypse
Brother you ain't got no inner soul put a sock in it

Now everybody's scared 'cause the damage that I've done with two songs is probably more than their album did
Be afraid, be afraid I'm a get'cha

Yeah I got the Midas touch, got gold diggers looking at my fine wrist watch
Even got the restaurant to fine dine this fox
Better call me by my name that's right it's Boss now
Levels levels I take the levels up triples
Just take those triples and triple it I'm so far gone

Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout running in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off, nigga
Now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in the clip, one in the chamber
17 ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me

[Chris Brown:]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Some people say I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks might've got it right
And some people say I drive a Cadillac car
Or sell my wares haunting hotel bars

I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talking sex to women, girls, in fast cars

I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you've found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight

I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight

And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out, anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
'Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah, yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same, again and again and again
I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight

Oh I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out, anyway
But I am not, anything like I was
'Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you want

When I see my future
It is with you
We'll get there
I want my children to be with you
We'll get there

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love

Behind my truth lies everything you want
Behind my truth lies everything you are

[Eminem]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
but he keeps on forgettin what he wrote down,
the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking now, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't

[Amy Lee]
My God my tourniquet
return to me salvation
my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation 

[Eminem]
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum

My God my tourniquet
return to me salvation
my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation 

[Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

My wounds cry for the grave
my soul cries for deliverance
will I be denied Christ

Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G

Probably rob these little dudes at fist point

To count the shit up and then bust the shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush the shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics

Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it

But just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly

'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho

I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I blow 80 holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
I double-edge sword it 'cause one place I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster

When my feet are on the ground
I'm gonna look around and see
See what's right and see what's there
And breathe fresh air, ever after, ever after
Breathe fresh air, ever after

6859,Paul McCartney,2021.0,When Winter Comes (Anderson .Paak Remix),"""McCartney III Imagined""","

When winter comes
And food is scarce
We'll warn our toes
To stay indoors
When summer's gone
We'll fly away
And find the sun
When winter comes

Must fix the fence by the acre plot
Two young foxes have been nosing around
The lambs and the chickens won't feel safe until it's done

I must dig a drain by the carrot patch
The whole crop spoils if it gets too damp
And where will we be with an empty store
When winter comes?

When winter comes
And food is scarce
We'll warn our toes
To stay indoors
When summer's gone
We'll fly away
And find the sun
When winter comes

I must find the time to plant some trees
In the meadow where the river flows
In time to come they'll make good shade for some poor soul

When winter comes
And food is scarce
We'll warn our toes
To stay indoors
When summer's gone
We'll fly away
And find the sun
When winter comes

And find the sun
When winter comes

4745,Eminem,,Boy Meets Girl,,"

Boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

'Cause boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

Now I know we said things
Did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns
Same teams
But your tempers' shit just bad as mine
You're same as me
But when it comes to love you just as blinded

Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Maybe it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much
To walk away doe

Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you, ""This is my fault""
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'll miss to let my fist hit the dry wall
Next time
There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want it back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
Ima tie her to the bed
And set her house on fire

Boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

'Cause boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

Listen
I'm sitting looking out the window like, ""Damn""
Tryna fix the situation that's at hand
You're still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me, you're gonna be mine when I'm knowing that you couldn't be

'Cause you haven't called
I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain
I ain't dealt with it all
I've been running around with other chicks
I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it but I just want the one that I was in love with

It's not the end of it
I'm tryna let you go
I can't
Get a grip of that I'm tryna let you know

You got hold some kind of control of me
I don't know what it is
But I gotta get you going for me

I'm working at it
It ain't getting no better
I'm just tryna be like
""Yeah, whatever, forget it.""
Instead of staring out this glass
Looking at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together
'Cause

Boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

'Cause boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

It sounds like a conversation
This a celebration
Let's toast to the fact I moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown
'Cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit that ever so talented Mr. Riply

How did I go from being a man that you argued with?
To meeting Dwayne Carter and putting alcohol an shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life
It's gonna be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you say one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when its most important fans are missing

Boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

'Cause boy meets girl
You were my dream my world
But I was blind
You cheated on me from behind

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangster, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain
For weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'

Willin' to stick out my neck
For respect
If it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me
People just want to see
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel
it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation
Ain't no conversation
If you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it
If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it, 'til it's empty
Tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge
I'll never fall or fold up

Even if my collar bones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble

It gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse
Anything I do bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2""
Who needs bullets
as soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em
And come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds
Assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, and calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not, 'cause

Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy
Until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, I'm a

It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night,
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you?
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, ""Bitch, you got a sick kid""
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
""How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?""
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler

With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like ""Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?""
""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit""
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

""I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed""
""Low down dirty even"" I'm low down and I'm shifty!

Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die

Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

They'll be so, they'll be so lonely baby
They get so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Now, the bell hop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never, never look back

And they get so, they get so lonely baby
Well they are so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Well, now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

Where you will be, you will be so lonely baby
Well you will be lonely
You'll be so lonely, you could die

Although it's always crowded
But you still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers to cry there in their gloom

Where they get so, they get so lonely baby
Well they're so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die

To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

And we will walk together
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendour where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit

From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers

Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?
Don't make me choose

Just a little bit of lovin' that's bonafide

656,Alec Benjamin,,The Hill I Will Die On (Demo),,"

Some have fought battles in fields full of cattle
And some have waged war out at sea
Some in militias and some with malicious intent
Some men just want to be
Free from oppression and so their aggression
Is worn like a badge on their sleeve
Some have fought battles from desks in Seattle
And some have waged war on the street

Guess this is the hill I will die on
I woke up this morning, put my suit and tie on
Walked down to the bus that I ride on
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill
I guess this is the will I will write on
The back of this bill, with my pen as my quill
And I hope you'll still love me when I'm gone
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill I will

Hmmm... na-na-na
Hmmm... na-na-na

Some fight with rifles and some use the Bible
And some use a shield and a knife
Some author libel which sometimes goes viral
And ruins an innocent life
Leaves an impression, teaches no lesson
And leads to regression and strife
Some fight to stifle and some 'cause it's primal
And some 'cause they're sure that they're right

Guess this is the hill I will die on
I woke up this morning, put my suit and tie on
Walked down to the bus that I ride on
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill
I guess this is the will I will write on
The back of this bill, with my pen as my quill
And I hope you'll still love me when I'm gone
The air felt so still, I guess this is the hill I will die on

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair...

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...

She knew no one cared...

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair

And patiently stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone.

The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes.

The call of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high.

Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Has kindly assisted me home.

[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
.Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don't give a shit about lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitz
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playing them hits
Oh, this my jam, this my shit
We don't know a word to a verse,
All we know is the chorus
'Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
'Cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new emphasis on our syllables

[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
Than I'm gonna feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
'Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing' cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes 2 to tango
You call this a lame flow
You bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
No more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist, tell her, ""We're in press heaven""
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the Internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu, Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong syllable

They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting 'cause ever since then it's been innocence
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
It's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook

I'm sick right into shows, riding on lolo's
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo's
Don't fuck with the dodo's, that's slang for dumb hoes

You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked lock,
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beat behind me playing, so you ain't hear anyway
You don't hear what I'm saying

And Em got soft

East, south, midwest, even up north
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk

For the history of rap

What happened to just spitting about living in the motherfucking city you at
In the grimiest condition, I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you could never be
It's a hitting, rhyme in the month deep

Hear out my wind pipes and I just chime

Less than I will tomorrow

See the sweet Hawaiian rose
See it blossom see it grow

I will be there by your side
You will always hear me say

You take up all my time
The days are long and the night will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain

Hello

Does that fire still glow
Or has it died out and melted like the snow

Tell me, what are you focused upon
Tell me, will it come to me after you're gone
Tell me quick with a glance on the side
Shall I hold you close or shall I let you go by
Tell me
Tell me

Are you lookin' at me and thinking of somebody else
Can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse
Do you have any secrets
That will only come out in time
Do you lay in your bed and stare at the stars
Is your main friend someone who's an old acquaintance of ours
Tell me
Tell me

Tell me, what's in back of them pretty brown eyes
Tell me, behind what door your treasure lies
Ever gone broke in a big way
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say
Tell me
Tell me

Is it some kind of game that you're playin' with me
Am I imagining something that never can be
Do you have any morals
Do you have any point of view
Is that a smile I see on your face
Will it take you to glory or to disgrace

Tell me, is my name in your book
Tell me, will you go back and take another look
Tell me the truth, tell me no lies

There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away

To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay

Going down to Lonesome Town, where the broken hearts stay

The streets are filled with regret

Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
Who's your daddy?

Daddy, what're you doing?

OK then! Everybody, listen up!

I'm going to Hell, who's comin' with me?

Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad gone crazy!

There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, I got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

[Dr Dre:]
Suck it Marshall

[Eminem:]
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby

I think my dad gone crazy!

It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana
and codeine and goddammit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Than quit bringing my flows, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why I'm so mean? If y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fucking teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump N' Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
plane
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave
Screaming at the sky, 'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, Parents are pissed, but the kids love
it
Nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

For I know not what I've done

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do

Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn) 'til somebody finally took me in
My great aunt and uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, well what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
Haha

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know but it feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

I said, father, please forgive me for I know not what I do

I used to laugh when I should cry
I used to let these feelings pass me by
But now that I believe them
I got no-one to leave them to me
You see I traded love for what I thought must be free

So I confess my loneliness
And I guess I've lost the best of the year
That I have lost it through my fingers like a golden breath of air
If I cared I wouldn't be singing this love song of the year
I know the time cannot erase the days
Love is past and I've gone away
From now on I'll make it very clear

Cos' I don't want to write
Another love song of the year
It's a lonely song and not too clear
But to me it's very dear
I guess this song can only be
My feelings went out in the sea of love

To me this has got to be the love song of the year
I know the time cannot erase the days
Love is past and I've gone away
From now on I'll make it very clear
Cos' I don't want to write

Another love song of the year
I used to laugh I used to cry
I used to laugh, these feelings passed me by
From now on I'll make it very clear cos' I don't want to write
Another love song of the year

Until the sun is shone up
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah

Well, it all began in the back of her car

And you've erased my favorite lines

Like cereal for dinner
And staying up all night

I remember how you looked but now
I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You didn't give a reason, I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I

Well, I bought a pen and I turned the page
Then I wrote about how I wish you'd stayed
I said all the things that I never got to say
Maybe when it's done I will feel okay

Get out the crane
Construction time again
What is it this time
We're laying a pipeline

Let the beads of sweat flow
Until the ends have met through
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy

On this golden day
Work's been sent our way

Working on the pipeline

From the heart of our land
To the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime

Every ounce of me must see it through

Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me
Right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare
With your smile
I'd never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights
What do I see
Some stupid bimbo
In a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat outta hell
I get to eat her dust
I never known anything to compare
With her laugh
I never known anything
That counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steal my heart

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart

Look at the city
Look at the streets
What do you see?
Look at the faces
Look at the people
They all wonder me

Suddenly hit by something
They don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
'Cos I've never seen anything
To compare with your smile
I've never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Ooh ee, baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be

Isn't it rich, are we a pair
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss, don't you approve
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns
Send in the clowns
Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there
Don't you love a farce,
My fault I fear,
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry my dear!
But where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Quick send in the clowns
What a surprise,
Who could foresee?
I'd come to feel about you
What you felt about me?
Why only now when I see
That you've drifted away?
What a surprise...
What a cliche...
Isn't it rich, isn't it queer
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns
Quick send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

I can remember when you left Kilkenny
And you told me, ""I'll return next year""
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

So is the outside world as you imagined?
Was it worth it, severing the ties?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

When you danced with me

Where the sweet magnolia grows

To every little star

On the hill above

And everyone I meet
That you and I are sweethearts
I'll shout it out
From the roof

That we two are complete hearts

And when I've said all I say
You may be old and gray
But you can't get away from me.

And I am falling down

The earth is moving
I feel it under my feet
And I'm still proving
That I can stand my ground
And my feet are bare
Haven't washed my hair
To be lost before you are found
Don't mean you're losing

And you gon' see it wherever there's struggle
I see my pain in your eyes man
So I know you're feelin' me
It's that twinkle man
That sign of struggle
I've seen it
In me

Cause everyday I can't help but see it
People ain't satisfied
And you're hatin' your 9 to 5
Everybody wanna live another life
But every goal or mountain you climb
Not to better your day
That do leave room for people to say
I guess you're livin' better now
Share a little of that cheddar now
Cause I remember days back when
A brother was hustlin and robbin' too
I done tossed up a letter now
On a whole nother level now
Still I can't enjoy my fame
Unless my people doin' the same
And gettin' money too

Once in awhile
(and see the twinkle in your eyes)
And I can see that you never wanna struggle no more
(Once in awhile I couldn't look at you)
Once in awhile
(and see the twinkle in your eyes)
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more

Cause everytime you ask me, I'm grindin'
It shouldn't have to be that way
You shouldn't have to pay my way
I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day
Got a little problem on the way
Bounty hunters checkin' state to state
Child support lady on your case
Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid

Oh
Is what you'll be askin'
God please hold it down for me
Don't let satan get ahold of me
I'm tryin' to tell you it can happen to me too
But it happened a lot worse to my brother
Muhammad thank God he recovered

Once in awhile

And I can see that you never wanna struggle no more

Once in awhile

And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more
(Once in awhile I choose look at you)
I see your pain now
I can feel you strain now
And I can see you cryin'
And inside you're dyin
We're all the same now
But you got to make change now

Once in awhile

And I can see that you don't ever struggle no more

I can taste more than feel
This burning inside is so real
I can almost lay my hands upon
The warm glow that lingers on

Moved, lifted higher
Moved, my soul's on fire
Moved, by a higher love

I surrender all control
To the desire that consumes me whole

And leads me by the hand to infinity
That lies in wait at the heart of me

Moved, lifted higher
Moved, my soul's on fire
Moved, by a higher love

Heaven bound on the wings of love
There's so much that you can rise above

Moved, lifted higher
Moved, moved, by a higher love
By a higher love

I surrender heart and soul
Sacrificed to a higher goal

Moved, moved by a higher love
By a higher love

Self-contained and self-content
No promises to keep
I've got things so together
That I just can't fall asleep
Walked the night and drank the moon
Got home at half past four
And I knew that no one marked my time
As I unlocked my door
It's really lovely to discover
That you like to be alone
Not to owe your man an answer
When he gets you on the phone
Not to share a pair of pork chops
When you crave champagne and cheese
And your aim becomes to please yourself
And not to aim to please
Oh they sold me when they told me
Two can live as cheap as one
But I'm learning twice your earning
Doesn't mean it's twice the fun
If you spend each dime and all your time
On someone else's schemes
I'm not needy but I'm greedy
And I live my deepest dreams
Take an hour in the shower
Use the water while it's hot in the tub
A hand to scrub my back
Is all I haven't got
Self-aware with self-esteem
Is selfishness a crime
I take the day for quite a ride
And I take my own sweet time
Time to spare and time to share
And grateful I would be
If just one damn man
Would share the need
To be alone with me

While you kept the night lit

Kick the dramatics

And with a little luck you can stay

Hey, why the long face?
You little night owl

Still you woke up with that face, wow!

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, I'm missing you like crazy

You saw me crying in the chapel.
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
One accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring

Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend

Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read

The FBI might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walkin' blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seein' rockets light up the night sky
Right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do, you can say good night
And bye-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face
As I gaze into space, as I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the bloodsuckin' leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dyin' the villain, not the hero, splendid
Stupendous way to end this
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flashback to September 7th
When 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the crazed lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block
In the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they for them to say ""touché""?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nothin'
When it's time, it's your time, you are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one

Hiding in your room, the things that we could do
You're like the sunshine in the lazy days of June
Hiding in your room, save me from this January gloom

And all the things I'd like to tell you
Save it for another day
Somewhere not so far, just for now
We'll shut those words away
And there you are, and there you were
You do your best or do your worst
All I want, all I need for now is you to save me

So can you save me from this January gloom
Hiding in your room, the things that we could do
You're like the sunshine in the lazy days of June
Hiding in your room, save me from this January gloom
(Hiding in your room)
Save me from this January gloom

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning
You knew I was losing
You told me to wake up, oh my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
And just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
And just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend

Just open up your heart, let music take control

Got that good soul in my feet

Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

Warm inside, yeah
I'd like to direct your attention
To something that needs directing to
A lot of people talk about
Dining in and eating out
I guess that's what this song's about
I know this is not a dining-room conversation
And you don't have to listen if you don't have the time
But let me remind you in case you don't already know
Dining out can happen down below

Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

Now what could be better than a home-cooked meal
How you wanna eat it depends on how you feel
You can eat all you want and you don't get fat
Now where else can you go for a meal like that
It's not fair to be selfish or stingy
Every girl should experience eating out
Sometimes when I come home from a hard day at work
I swear it's all I can think about

Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different kind of kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

Colonel Sanders says it best
""Finger-licking good""
Let's put what you've learned to the test
Can you make a fire without using wood?
Are you still hungry; aren't you glad we came?
I'm glad you brought your raincoat
I think it's beginning to rain

Everybody's talking about
Wanting that and needing this
I'd just like to know
If you want to learn a different way to kiss

So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

So won't you go down where it's warm inside
Go down where I cannot hide
Go down where all life begins
Go down that's where my love is

That's where my love is
Come inside
That's where all life begins
It's warm inside

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Okay, let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes

And there's really not that many of us

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

I got so sick of being on my own
Now the devil won't leave me alone
It's almost like I found a friend
Who's in it for the bitter end
Our consciences are always so much heavier than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time...?

Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
Turn on the charm for me tonight
I've got my heavy heart to hold me down
Once it falls apart my head's in the clouds
So I'm taking every chance I got
Like the man I know I'm not

So sick of wasting all my time
How in God's name did I survive?
I need a little sympathy
To sore my insecurities
Our consciences are always so much heavier than our egos
I set my expectations high
So nothing ever comes out right

So shoot a star on the boulevard tonight
I think I'll figure it out with a little more time
But who needs time...?

Once it falls apart my head's in the clouds

A heavy heart on the boulevard tonight, oh
Shooting stars watch me fall apart tonight, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Once it falls apart my head's in the clouds

""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""

""No reason to get excited"", the thief, he kindly spoke,
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late"".

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

Beyond the horizon, behind the sun 
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun 
In the long hours of twilight underneath the stardust above 
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love 

I'm touched with desire 
What I do 
Through flame and through fire 
I'll build my world around you 

Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or fall 
Love waits forever, for one and for all 

Beyond the horizon, across the divide 
Around about midnight, we'll be on the same side 
Down in the valley the water runs cold 
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul 

My wretched heart is pounding 
I felt an angel's kiss 
My memories are drowning 
In mortal bliss 

Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game 
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same 

Beyond the horizon, the night winds blow 
The theme of a melody from many moons ago 
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime 
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time 

It's dark and it's dreary 
I've been pleading in vain 
I'm wounded, I'm weary 
My repentance is plain 

Beyond the horizon over the treacherous sea 
I still can't believe that you have set aside your love for me 

Beyond the horizon, underneath crimson skies 
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes 
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone 
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone 

It's the right time of the season 
Somebody there always cared 
There's always a reason 
Why some one's life has been spared 

Beyond the horizon, the sky is so blue 
I've got more than a lifetime to live loving you

How long can I stay
In this nowhere cafe 'fore night turns into day
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on

There's a moment when
All old things become new again
But that moment might have come and gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on

I look away but I keep seeing it
I don't want to believe but I keep believing it
Shadows dance upon the wall
Shadows that seem to know it all

Am I too blind to see
Is my heart playing tricks on me
I'm lost in the crowd, all my tears are gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on

Everything I touch seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn, you are always here
I'll run this race until my earthly death
I'll defend this place with my dying breath

From a cheerless room
In a curtain gloom, I saw a star from Heaven fall
I turned and looked again but it was gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you which keeps me living on

To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause

Yes, sir. Take one! It's the Mighty Jungle Band!

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, ""Girl, I like your face.""
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's stores
Buys a twenty-carat golden ring 
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And when he gives it to her she begins to sing 

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home, sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on 
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built a home, sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand 
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

[Paul:] Yes?
[John:] Hey! Listen!
[Paul:] It's all changed, now, Brian. They're not doing that, no actors.
[John:] It's all changed, now.
[Brian:] But this is what I wonder. In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?
[John:] No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film. You should have seen the rest.
[Brian:] Yes?
[John:] Rubbish!
[Brian:] Was it, really?
[John:] Even worse, yes.
[Brian:] Who was worst?
[John:] Oh, Paul.
[Brian:] I see.
[Paul:] I think John was about the worst.
[John:] No, it was you.
[Paul:] Oh, Ringo was very good. He was. He's a good lad.
[Brian:] He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin. Do you think that's right?
[John:] He was miming.
[Paul:] You, too, with Jason.
[John:] Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
[Brian:] Beginning to look like that. Now, then--
[Ringo:] All right, John. Can you hear me?
[Paul:] Can you hear him? Hello!
[Brian:] Not really. I hope not. I hope not!
[John:] We brought you the flowers, Ring.

Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life

Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, ""Te extraño""
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie

2466,Barbra Streisand,2012.0,Lost In Wonderland,"compilation: ""Release Me""","

I'm all alone in a place I have never been.
I see a door to a garden and wander in.
And though my journey has barely begun
I am spun like a top to the top of the universe and
High in a spiral of ice I gaze upon a scene
That flickers far below me.
And what I see is a crinkle of colors and sounds.
Colors and sounds.

I can hear tinkles of crystal
and I can see sparkles of mist on the spangles
And I can feel tangles of tingles and sprinklings of angles
And inklings of angels around.

A rabbit crosses my path unexpectedly.
I hear a sigh of despair as he passes me.
I have a feeling that rabbit is late
For wherever he's going whatever he's headed for is my destination.
Oh, show me the way to stay here in this world
Because here's where the right things happen.
Oh baby here's where the good things are.

Looking at this enormous butterfly,
Wondering if he cares to dance with me.
Delicate as a flower carved of chrysophrase,
Idly I ponder how far have I yet to find it.
I've got to find it and act as though I've lost it.
Otherwise I'm lost in wonderland.

I've got to find it or else I am bound
To the empty ground bleak and vast.
Where dark spells are cast.

Flooring above me and ceiling below me
And chandeliers rising like tremulous towers
And tables and chairs and beds hanging like blossoms
In turquoise and purple and green.

You were asleep so I guess you were not aware,
I took a walk through your mind and I lingered there.
But what I found I can never reveal to you
Not with my voice nor the pitch of my flute recall it.
You'll simply have to come walking with me
One day into that wonderland shining behind your eyes,
Beyond the gossamer doors of sleep.
Just sleep...

[Gwen Stefani:]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Eminem (Gwen Stefani):]
I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
'Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
'Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
'Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)

[Eminem:]
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I on-line? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, 'cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
(It) just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

[Gwen Stefani:]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Eminem:]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, 'cause

[Eminem:]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
'Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Eminem:]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silver screen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat 'cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that ""Soundbombing"" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't

[Gwen Stefani:]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

(And you like me just the way I'm not.)

Can I pick you up for,
Another night on the north shore?
Do you even want to see my face again?
I'm a waste of chances,
Full of bad romances,
Your favorite enemy,
And your most hated friend.

When it hurts it hurts,
You wonder if it's worth it.
But when it works it works,
When it's broke it's perfect.

Woah oh!
Never seem to please you, no,
Don't you ever let me go,
I know your heart is shut, shut, shut.
And don't you know,
Nothing's gonna change us.
Girl, all because I like you just the way you aren't,
And you like me just the way I'm not.
(And you like me just the way I'm not.)

You're a classic case of,
Foolish, young and in love,
But you don't even know what love could do to us.
We are brash and reckless,
Made of glass and careless,
We break apart the moment we both feel too much.

'Cause when it hurts it hurts,
You wonder if it's worth it.
But when it works it works,
When it's broke it's perfect.

Woah oh!
Never seem to please you, no,
Don't you ever let me go,
I know your heart is shut, shut, shut.
And don't you know,
Nothing's gonna change us.

And you like me just the way I'm not.

Opposites distract,
We fall between the cracks,
Forget about each other 'til we get each other back.

Go!

6772,Paul McCartney,2007.0,Why So Blue,"""Memory Almost Full""","

Staring from a cardboard castle
Down and out
One of life's young students
Finds out what it's all about
Paper flutters
Angry taxy drivers shout

From the pages of a paper
Candles shine
On a perfect table
Laid for two who love to dine
They suggest a highly recommended wine
Once again the same old line

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Weary carriage horses stand in single file
Someone at a crowded bus stop
Wears a friendly smile
Touching nerves that
No one's heard from in a while
Papers from the same old file

Why so sad
My fine young friend
Why so blue

Sometimes
When eyes meet you know
They have to meet again
Sometimes
Birds of a feather
Got to fly together

From a dingy attic window
Candles shine
On a perfect table
Laid for two who love to dine
Now they drink the
Highly recommended wine
Free at last and feeling fine

I'm so glad
My fine young friend
Glad for you

I'm so glad
My fine young friend
Glad for you

You used to be so blue, you used to be so blue
Why so blue

A little too reckless
Now all my emotions

Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

Never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile

And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along
When you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, for you were in my song
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you.

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me.

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

(Ha)
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Lainnie I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)

Mommy, we're home!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody, put your hands where my eyes can see!

Yo
Everywhere we go people know we roll deep as fuck
Forty, fifty Samoans, they knowin' when D-Bo was
50, Tweezy, Obie, there won't be no ho in us
They pop shit like they gonna do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We changed the way we move, so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us (Ha)
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much, it's just
That if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
'Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon' be in it
No one's gonna hear nothing, no one's gonna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is 'bout it, 'bout it
The noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
'Til the club closes, and clears out, and that's when they see you flattened
Nobody saw it happen, all 'cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's 'bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off

Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
We ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
Shit just ain't the same when AK's get to sprayin'
""Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1""
It ain't about hip-hop, 'cause those days are gone
It ain't about tryna rip shots to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
'Cause ""Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1""

Took my strap off my holster, 'cause shit is getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you done
When you stood against the gangster who live and die by the gun
Caught a hot one, sprayin' you bitches 'til there was none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
You silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches for envyin' all our riches
The game's just like a midget, you clockin' a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon

Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
We ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
Shit just ain't the same when AK's get to sprayin'

It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
'Cause ""Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1""

Uh, Ganxsta, Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On the shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these imitators parading like they some players
Tryna save hip-hop the task is something greater
'Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivators
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a full circle with homies that's s'posed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

Shit's about to change, 'cause we ain't playin' no games
We ain't budgin', neither are they, we ain't sayin' no names
Shit just ain't the same when AK's get to sprayin'

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you (feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it, even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and re-playing old conversations
Over-thinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('Cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I regret it if I didn't say this isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else

If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I go back to you
I go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you

You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you

Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Time marches on

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

You came to me and shown me
That love is the answer
I will save you, protect you from everything
We should live in togetherness with one another

People all over the world
When you start to lend a helping hand
You can make it a better place
This song is for you
To bring love and harmony to this world

I can hear people crying
My heart weeps when I see your tears
I will give my shoulder whenever you need
So let us sing together

People all over the world
Your smile makes me smile
You can make our future brighter
Let the world shine with happy smiles

People all over the world
When you start to lend a helping hand
You can make it a better place
This song is for you
To bring love and harmony to this world

Your smile makes me smile
You can make our future brighter
Let the world shine with happy smiles

Rape and pillage proves
To win the public vote
Someone tell me who will take the prize
And who takes the fall
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
And down-town comes again
And her masks are shifting like a chameleon
Someone tell me why she breaks my fall
And then breaks my heart
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
So confused
When you're lost in the groove
Wow!
So confused
When you're lost in the groove

To be alone with you
Just you and me
Now won't you tell me the true
Ain't that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Ev'rything is always right
When I'm alone with you.

To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evenings slips away
It only goes to show
That while life's pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when I'm alone with you.

They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But you're always what I'm thinkin' of
I wish the night were here
Bringin' me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms.

I'll always thank the Lord
When my working day's through
I get my sweet reward
To be alone with you.

Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut

Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod

I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God

Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it

Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

When Jesus found me,(Jesus found me in my sinful life)

Now I'm singing (Now I'm singing this happy song)
because I'm happy (because I'm happy as I go along)

If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
What would I do, (What would I do when a tear fills my eyes)
what would I do (What would I do when it's my time to die)
Well I'd be lonely, discouraged
Burdened on the way
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day

I'd be so friendless (I'd be friendless all alone and blue)
and I'd be helpless (I'd be helpless, wouldn't know what to do)
And I don't know (I don't know) just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side

Though you are gone, I still wear your ring
They're playing the song we used to sing
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past

The letters you wrote I treasure them so
And I hear your voice wherever I go
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past

In the rustle of a breeze; in the patter of the rain
In the rushing of the seas, all I hear is your name
Come back my love and once you are near
Darling I know no more will I hear
Echoes of love, echoes of love
'cause you'll be with me right in my heart

Echoes of love, echoes of love
Cause you'll be with me right in my heart

How many of their brothers and sisters linger in jail
How much poison did their inhale
How many black cats crossed their trail.

Seven by seven they head for heaven
Eight by eight their got to the gate
Nine by nine they drank the wine
Ten by ten they drank it again.

How many tomorrows have they given away
How many compared to yesterday
How many more without any reward
How many more can they afford.

Sixteen bars this ain't enough to put some ink to

It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (Ack)
What else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

Ah, damn!
Fucking bitch
"
110,ABBA,,Just Like That,,"

Until that day
My life had been a river
Following the same, pre-destinated course,
Suddenly detouring so unexpectedly
With uncompromising force.
My strongholds broke down all too easily;
I remember well,
How it did embarrass me;
I hung on to his every smile
Marveled at his style

Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

And once again, the river's flowing slowly,
Following its safe and uneventful course.
Now the tears have dried,
it's become a pleasant break,
I recall without remorse.
But now and then
I wonder where he is
And I will admit,
he had something that I miss.
I guess he was a rolling stone;
The only one I've known.

Just like that...
He walked into my house
As smug as a cat
He was handsome and smart
Walked away with my heart
Just like that...
He found a temporary home in my flat
Telling innocent lies
Throwing dust in my eyes
But I led him on,
Knowing that someday soon he'd be gone
Just like that...
As though he only stopped awhile for a chat;
But my secrets he learned
Leaving no stone unturned

You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say

Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul

Girl, girl, girl
You gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go

Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Help me, I'm flaming

Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke

Cause your kisses lift me higher

And you light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer
The flames are reaching my body
Please won't you help me

Passionate, but I don't give no fucks

You know what I need
When my heart bleeds
I suffer from greed
A longing to feed
On the mercy in you

I can't conceal
The way I'm healed
The pleasure I feel
When I have to deal
With the mercy in you

I would do it all again
Lose my way and fall again
Just so I could call again
On the mercy in you

When here in my mind
I feel inclined
To wrongly treat you unkind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you

I would lose my way again
Be led hopelessly astray again
Just so I could pray again
For the mercy in you

When here in my mind
I have been blind
Emotionally behind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you

I've seen the tears and the heartache, and I felt the pain
I've seen the hatred in so many lives, and lost in vain
And yet through this darkness there's always a light that shines through
And takes me back home
Takes me back home

All of the promises broken
And all of the songs left unsung
Seems so far away as I make my way back to you

[Chorus:]
You gave me faith and you gave me a world to believe in
You gave me your love to believe in
And feeling this love I can rise up above
And be strong and be whole once again

I know that dreams we hold on to, can just fade away
And I know that words can be wasted, with so much to say
And I when I feel helpless there's always a hope that shines through
And makes me believe
Makes me believe

And I see for one fleeting moment
A paradise under the sun
I drift away and I make my way back to you

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Life goes on
Can leave all sweet sorrow and pain
And life, hold on
To all that you are
To all that we'll be
And I can go on once again

[Chorus: x2]

Because your love hears my soul once again
I can live and I can dream once again
Because you made me believe

Mayday situation overload
I'm restless, obsessed with your future
And all my worries they don't bother you
Collected, you render me useless

Right now
I think that you think that I'm half drunk
Searching for something of substance
Casually dropping a line
Designed
To keep you next to me

I can't awkwardly craft in advance
I know, that you wouldn't fall for that
You say, ""Shut up and take my hand.""
And we carry on

I don't wanna say goodnight
The city comes alive, when we're together
Why can't Thursday last forever
I don't wanna say goodnight
I've never been so sure
Just do it for the memories
Do it for Baltimore
And do it for me

Hot damn, look at me now
I'm all caught up
Riding the high of my good luck
Casually dropping a line
Designed
To keep you next to me

And I bet you never thought you would fall again
So much for keeping this, just friends
Shut up and kiss me now

Said she got it from her mama she a freak too
And she got a couple friends she could bring too

Look who's digging their own grave
That is what they all say
You'll drink yourself to death

Look who makes their own bed
Lies right down within it
And what will you have left?

Out on the front doorstep
Drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this

Living beyond your years
Acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
It's just begun

Standing on the cliff face
Highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death

Look out to the future
But it tells you nothing
So take another breath

Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
And this is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

You put up your defenses when you leave
You leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be

You're putting up your armor when you leave
And you leave because you're certain
Of who you want to be

Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
And this is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave

Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language

You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go—hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh (Ha ha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City, uh
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude

Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause…

That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race

Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your motherfuckin' throat like—

—throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?

I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides
In my eyes
Never getting dry,
So I get high,
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall
With the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever,
But I know that I never wanna settle down,
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts
And I dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
Like our last kiss. It was perfect,
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant
Or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh

Because if I was gonna go somewhere,
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware,
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around
To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low

Because if you want,
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say
That I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

5592,Metallica,1986.0,Welcome Home (Sanitarium),"""Master Of Puppets""","

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Seems I've played the game for much too long
I let people buy my love and I
Never got to sing my songs for you

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love you pay your dues

Say that happiness cannot be measured
And a little pain can bring you all life's little pleasures
What a joke

I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, ""Love yourself.""
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, ""Love yourself.""

I had all my bets laid all on you
Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose
In the game of love I've paid my dues

Guess I'm waiting for my place in your sun
Wish I had the chance to know you and it wasn't stormy weather
What a shame, who's to blame?

I was not your woman, I was not your friend
But you gave me something to remember
No other man said, ""Love yourself.""
Nobody else can
We weren't meant to be
At least not in this lifetime
But you gave me something to remember
I hear you still say, ""Love yourself.""

We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm

The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading for the light

I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

We held each other
Praying for a spark
Two crazy partners
Scrambling in the dark

Now where are we going
Searching in the night
We had a feeling
It's going to be alright

I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

Two crazy partners
Searching in the night
We've got a feeling
It's going to be alright

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense
Go in, and gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A., Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my -pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
Well I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rolling out at last

Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

This ol' airport's got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain

Can't slow me down, I'd go on

I know what's real, I know what's right
I'm not afraid, a wounded dove
I can be tender in a world so tough

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know

The winds of the heart can blow me down
But I get right up and I stand my ground
I've tasted fear, my share of pain
The wasted tears of love in vain
I've held you tight, pushed you away
Now with all my might I beg you to stay

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know

I know what I want, I know what I need
But there's just one thing I must believe
Deep in the night by a dying flame
You will be there when I call your name

I'm sure I could face the bitter cold
But life without you, I don't know

It's a lazy afternoon
And the beetle bugs are zooming
And the tulip trees are blooming
And there's not another human in view
But us two
It's a lazy afternoon
And the farmer leaves his reaping
And the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping up stream
As we dream
A fat pink cloud hangs over the hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still
You can hear the grass as it grows
It's a hazy afternoon
And I know a place that's quiet, except for daisies running riot
And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me

It's what you've been waitin' for, Funkmaster Flex
Big Kap, Def Jam records givin' it to you, baby
Yo, Eminem, show these motherfuckers what time it is, baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad
'Til I got a million dollars, shit, now if I only had
Some fuckin' hair I'd pull it faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm tryin' to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate this straightjacket, it ain't latchin', they can't lock it
So they stapled my hands to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwin' their fuckin' self at it
My head is achin', I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is takin' too long to bring me this se-da-dation (Come on!)
Anyway, I got down with Dre (What up?)
The first man who taught me how a Glock sounded to spray
Runnin' up and down the street, screamin', ""Fuck the police!""
When you still had your mother's fuckin' nipple stuck in your teeth (You fuckin' baby)
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler, ""Bravo!""
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch
And beat my kids in public – suck my dick, bitch!
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face
But I won't, 'cause you probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, wit' your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative (Wanna pf-fight?)
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talkin'
Walkin' like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumblin'
Mumblin' a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on Earth would I need drugs when I fly on kites?
Motherfucker! Slim Shady (Dr. Dre)
I'm drunk, pass the TEC

'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin', off and on, Eminem is on (Hey)
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin', off and on, Eminem is on (Hey)
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fuckin' girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych! I'm just jokin', for Christ's sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape 'cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me, 'cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home, it hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain bein' baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrés
Hailie Jade, Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter – fuck you, lady!
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes (Fuck y'all)
The neighborhood that I grew up in, you could die for nothin'
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fuckin' man raped with a Band-Aid
Over his mouth and shove his head in a fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can or what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buyin' this shit
Quit fuckin' buyin' it, I'm tired, bitch, I'm dyin' to quit
Hip-hop is universal now, it's so commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of bein' judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since three years old

'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin', off and on, Eminem is on (Hey)
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on (Ayo)

Healed
Or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine
Have you found a way to escape?
Are you here
Just because I need you?
Can we hole up?
A big freeze is heading our way

We are on a hiding to nowhere
We still hope
But our dreams are not the same, no
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay

Fight
Or will you show me mercy?
We expelled
The goodness from our hearts
Are you here
Just to prove your winning?
Can we hole up
And ride out this electrical storm?

We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith
But our truths are not the same, no
Don't give up
Don't let the magic leave us
Stop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't you let the sun in your heart decay

Don't give up
Don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me

Broken glass and cigarettes writin' on the wall
It was a bargain for the summer and I thought I had it all
I was the one who gave you everythin', the one who took the fall
You were the one who would do anythin', one who can't recall
Where she was while she was sleepin' in another woman's bed
Or the doctor's, or the lawyer's, or a stranger that she met
If there's nothin' I can gain from this or anythin' at all
It'd be the knowledge that you gave me when I thought I'd heard it all

It was a long time for you
It was a long time for me
It'd be a long time for anyone but
Looks like it's meant to be

Social class and registers, cocaine in the hall
All the way from California on the way to your next call
To those non-negotiations to simulate a cause
For the betterment of evils and your ways around the laws
That keep you up and sittin' pretty on a pedestal or bed
An' now you're sleepin' like an angel, never mind who you gave head
If there's somethin' I can make of this or anything at all
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all

It was a wrong time for you
It was a wrong time for me
It was the wrong time for anyone, but
Looks like I got to see for myself

If I could go back in time to the place in my soul
There, all alone, lonely teardrops, ooh, are calling you
But I don't want to know it, now, 'cause knowing you
It won't change a damn thing, but there was a time

I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And fall in love just me and you.

There's a lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance.

Lying next to her by the ocean 
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land.

And when it's time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it's so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

He blew his mind out in a car;
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy;
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Can't you see
I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice
Treat me good
Treat me like you really should
'Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart

Muß i' denn, muß i' denn
Zum Städtele hinaus,
Städtele hinaus
Und du mein Schatz bleibst hier

Muß i' denn, muß i' denn
Zum Städtele hinaus,
Städtele hinaus
Und du mein Schatz bleibst hier

There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Sei mir gut
Sei mir gut
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart

I'm sitting here wishing for something that's missing
I'm waiting for you to tell me
that time keeps on passing
I'm hoping, I'm asking
to stand by your side
at least for tonight

let's follow through with this reckless dream
that's tearing me up inside
and all the time we've been so innocent

So don't you go I've got you where I want you
and I'm never letting go
hit the lights we'll be all right
tonight our dreams come true

now lets take our chances
please give me your answer
it's all up to you so please take me away
we've waited for so long
I can't say it feels wrong to close my eyes
when all I see is you

let's follow through with this reckless dream
it's tearing me up inside
and all the time we'll make it seem
like we have nothing to hide nothing to hide

So don't you go I've got you where I want you
and I'm never letting go
hit the lights we'll be all right
tonight our dreams come true [x3]

Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby, since you been gone

In your finger tips

On those lovely lips
So

Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down

I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
And strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork
But harder to read

Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time
I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me
For dear life
And blocking my way

Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
Won't you stay?
She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I'll stay, anyway
Cos she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from

Damage Incorporated
Go

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here

4777,Eminem,,Infinite (F.B.T. Remix),,"

Ah, yeah (It's like this, like this)
This is Eminem, baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, they don't know shit about this, for the '96

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind, and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers
'Til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits a snare and bass on a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion
There ain't no time to be starin', gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland

I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

Bust it! I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assuming all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster will in me
That always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit

I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell
Well, I was sent from it
I went to it, serving a sentence
For murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

I'm falling in love, tonight
Somehow, I know
The beautiful world tonight
Is sharing, it's glow

When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you

'till you walked by
I laughed and played the game
One last kiss, then goodbye
And out went the flame

But somehow, you've changed me dear
This time, it's true
I'm falling in love tonight
With you

I am recovering
The faith of a child
By a part of my heart
I was reckless and wild
I am recovering
The hope that I lost
The part of my soul
That paid the cost

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my piece of mind

I am recovering
Anxiety addict
A broken perfectionist
Somewhat erratic
I am recovering
A constant regretter
Hold it against her
At least till forever

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my piece of mind

Hold me
As I fall apart, baby
Hold me
Here in the dark
Cause the old me
Run just as far as I could from my heart
Well, I'm going back to the start

Little by little, day by day
One step at a time
Shake off the devil, oh
Take back my piece of mind
Tell him I love him, yeah
Take back my piece of mind

Eyes goes right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair

When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandit fly
Dig that trench, watch that blast
Shell-shock come, comin' fast

We might get laid by a hand grenade

I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull, dead to rights
Volunteer, one pace back
On the beach
Ain't no place for kids

Well, the flack is high on the bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire rage, and you're in a blitz
Keep your head, or you're blown to bits
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
You know what it means?
Do you know what it means?

This

Who go there, is it friend or foe?
Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
And peace talks die in Geneva town

There's a fragile tension
That's keeping us going
It may not last forever
But oh when it's flowing

There's something magical in the air
Something so tragic we have to care

There's a strange obsession
That's drawing us nearer
We don't understand it
It never gets clearer

There's something mystical in our genes
So simplistic it kicks and screams

Oh when we're teetering
On the edge of collapse
Nothing can keep us down

There's a dizzying feeling
That's keeping us flying
Through glittering galas
Without even trying

There's something radical in our hands
Nothing logical to our plans

Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles

We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump, in the dead of the night

Can I get my glass of tea? Mmm, nothing like it!
At this time I would like very much to do a Folksong. Since Folksongs,
I think are still popular today. Uhm, this one is in Latvian and it's
from Latvia. And it's about this Tahitian girl who uhm, had this lover.
And then one day this lover decides that he doesn't like her anymore
and likes her sister better. So she decided that the only thing to do
naturally was to kill herself, see. So one day, oh, was very nice out
about 75 degrees, and she was taking this walk down to the river to
drown when she, she tripped over this rock see. And uhm, oh it was
awful I mean, she broke her glasses, she scrapped her knees. And uhm,
just at this minute the lover and the sister happen to come by in a
taxicab. So, see they saw her on the floor and she, having an
astigmatism in her left eye, she thought that it was a wild bore. So,
she figured oh boy I'd better get down to the river fast to drown so
she runs down there and what do you know the river was frozen. So I
mean she just stood there you know and she went tchhh, like that. Tch,
and uhm, because, I mean, she couldn't do it that day. See, it was a
small town they only had one river, so. Anyway than she figured, oh
it's getting late, better get home cause her mamma would be worried
and would kill her if she was late for supper you know. So, I mean,
she gets up and she starts walking around home and she bumps in to
this guy, and what do you know, he turns out to be an optometrist.
And just happens to happen to have her ""suscription"". So, anyway, uh?
Oh, I'm sorry ""suBscription"".So anyway, I mean, she's I don't want
you to think that this is one of those Hollywood-like stories: She
gets the glasses and sees happily ever after. I mean, this is, you
know, no like that. I mean she had to pay for the glasses just like
you and me, she ... well, oh well, I mean, I don't want you to think
that I'm lying but she did get about a dollar fifty off, dollar
sixty-five? So anyway, uhm... this guy (Oh) turned out to be very
nice and he even told her where she could find another river.
So, I'll tell you the truth, this girl was a real creep. I mean,
you know who would wanna sing a song about her? I mean, her sister
was really much nicer. And uhm, I mean, I, I think she came from
a better family.

[Singing]
Call me a boob
Call me a schlemiel
Call me a brain with a missing wheel
Call me what you will
But nonetheless I'm still
In love with Harold Mingert
It's not because he has a car
Arnie Fleisher has a car
And a car is just a car
But if Harold didn't have a car too his name
I guess I'd love him just the same
Call me what you will
But nonetheless I'm still
In love with Harold Mingert
And it's not because he has a wealthy family
Arnie Fleischer has a wealthy family
But money isn't everything
And if Harold didn't have a car too his name
I know I'd love him just the same
But sometimes I ask myself why than
Do I than love Harold Mingert
Harold isn't handsome or clever or smart
And I don't find romance and a dance in his heart
The only answers I can think about
Harold Mingert's money and Harold Mingert's car
Call me what you will
But non the less I'm still
In love with Harold Mingert
Also Arnie Fleisher!

My warped and worried mind resortd
To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about
A pretty girl I used to know but wouldn't know if we met face to face
And defying every logic known

I wish all the time machine could take me back again
To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout
Referring to her only as my little friend
Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away

The child has grown into a woman of the world
I assume just knowing that she knew so much of life at such a tender age
I learned from her the whispered things the big boys at the pool hall talk about
The thrill and disappointment, fear and shame that first love brings
But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend

The fragrance of the green grass mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
The moonlight night I kissed and cried and swore I'd never touch another girl
But time moved fast and I moved on and I loved others time and time again
But with each time I thought of her and always gave a little more

Assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend
Oh-oh-oh assembled love and rememberance for my little friend

A daydream spills from my corked head
Breaks free of my wooden neck
Left a nod over sleeping waves
Like bobbing bait for bathing cod
Floating flocks of candled swans
Slowly drift across wax ponds

The men all played along
To marching drums
And boy did they have fun
Behind the sea
They sang (hey!)
So our matching legs
Are marching clocks
And we're all too small
To talk to God
Yes, we're all too smart
To talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch
Sprouting sons and ageless daughters

Don't you know
Don't you know
That those watermelon smiles
Just can't ripen underwater
Just can't ripen underwater

The men all played along
To marching drums
And boy did they have fun
Behind the sea
They sang (hey!)

Are marching clocks
And we're all too small

It don't matter, baby
If you got it, you got it
Seduce me baby, seduce me

Just to get my attention, send a note and a drink
When we made eye connection, she nodded and winked
On this note it said, ""It's 'bout time we get together
Let's dance now, hook up later, we can do whatever.""
She had confidence, it's all part of the game
'Cause to her, who I'm with don't really mean a thing
She knew what I liked and now I'm thirsty for more, baby

Sensuous, sexy, erotic
How you working your body
You gon' make me do it, do it to you

Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

Baby, turn around, stick it out, I wanna see it
She'll make the first move, smooth, intoxicating
She crazy (I like it, I'ma be honest)
I'm fighting not to lose control
I'm feeling a little tension, don't know whose watching
Getting big (in too deep, and I can't stop it)

Long as you're satisfied
'Cause it's so hard to resist
Ooh, your body got me on fire
Got vivid thoughts in my mind
The positions that I'm gonna try
But is it worth all the hurt?
Should I risk it just for one night?
Once I give in
She's gonna win
Either way I lose

I'm trying to chill, but she got me on the spot
She's so cocky and the way that she watching me
Got me feeling hot, uh
Shorty know that I got a girl and I really can't break the rules
Plus paparazzi snapping shots
And it's hard for me to shake these fools
So do I one) put it on her, work my way to the front?
Do I two) play my part and sure, don't try to pull no stunts?
Or maybe three) (yeah) chase the cat 'cause she's sending me on the hunt

Watch yourself
Before you get
Blown away

[Styles P]
You know where I come from
The place where your fate is a mic
Or a bull or a dum dum
A jail cell a pine box
And brothers is dumb young
Young boys
Still bustin' guns for the slum
that they come from
Cops is the only ones they gonna run from
That's it
They puttin' they hood up
But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck
You're gonna ride on a man and catch 25
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me I play the hood baby
Not in the
Mama got a little church I could join
But I didn't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join
But I didn't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back
I'm in cold sweats
'bout to do some dirt
In some dirty black old sweats
If you known you should've shown the way
Most of the hood bout to get blown away

[Chorus (Akon):]
'cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

See I ain't never shot nobody
But I'm known for fightin'
So when I strike man
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child could take a life pulling the trigger
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
See your target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say guns don't kill people, people do
So when you're hit man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
My eyes swollen
Mom's cryin' they don't know what happened
My pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat then I got a blade
That hit you off

[Chorus (Akon)]

Keep my eye out for jakes
Ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing'll make you laugh it'll make you cry
This quiet nigga, he'll take you life
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there
When you're ridin'
But I'll stay to myself
So if you see me out there
with a bear we fightin'
Then nigga go help the bear

And when it goes down
Baby all you gotta do is...

Just tell me which way you like that.
All you gotta do is
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that

7033,Queen,1976.0,Drowse,"""A Day At The Races""","

It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall 
It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings, to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
Half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolhall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a smalltown boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives 
Wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for
breakfast I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Jimi Hendrix, he was good,
William The Conqueror
Now, who else do I like?
"
4588,Eminem,2009.0,My Darling(Digital bonus track),"""Relapse""","

Look, if I were to rap
About the crap
That's out
That's the route
You'd probably want me to take
'Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers

If I was to say something about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants
'Cause I'm white, and he's white
So he's like my competition
I mean, right?

Nope, Paul Wall is dope
And so's Bubba, so
But I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali Shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum
Like I'm asleep it's awesome
I'm like a sleeping giant
And when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem

I was taught if you're gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why
Look them dead in the eye
Then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls for this rap game and it goes
1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3
That ain't the hook, now follow me

There's nothing else for me to say
My public adores me
Everybody bores me
They're just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers, ""Come nearer.""

Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too

Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too

A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal

Criminal
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
Hate fags? The answer's ""yes""

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfucking balls
You'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em

""Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail.""
Get it? Checking the 'male'?

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an ""amen"". A-men!

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal

My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink more liquor
To fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word
My morals went ... when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me
You won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
""The Maniac's in"" in place of the doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather
So I'm taking his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waiting on you
Aight

Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
Aha?
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Go, go, go!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

Never molested, though in the wrong

Farther along we'll understand why

When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear

Living so wicked year after year

Made my money by cutting grass
Got fired by a fried chicken ass
All in a small town, Napanee

And think to myself

In whose arms, the time and place?

About the trees and the birds
And their families
Humanity, now I can see
The Devil's hold on this world

Hurry up, I just can't wait
I gotta do it now, I can't be late
I know I'm not afraid I got to get out the door
If I don't do it now, I won't get anymore

You try to criticize my drive
If I lose, I don't feel paralyzed
It's not the game, it's how you play
And if I fall, I get up again now

I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over
I get up again, over and over

Got past my first mistake
I'll only give as much as I can take
You're never gonna see me standin' still
I'm never gonna stop 'til I get my fill

It doesn't matter who you are
It's what you do that takes you far
And if at first you don't succeed
Here's some advice that you should heed

You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over
You get up again, over and over

I'm not afraid to say I hear a different beat, oh
And I'll go out in the street, yeah
And I will shout it again
From the highest mountain

Thinkin' about your lips and the way they kiss
There's so much I really miss about you
Sittin' on the beach, you were still in reach
And I haven't felt free without you
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses, I lay them there, I lay them there for you

You've been on my mind every single night
I can't visualize life without you
I've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep
But there's something that I need to go through
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses, I lay them there, I lay them there for you
I lay them there for you

So I lay a dozen roses for the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you

[Fanny:]
It was a lucky April shower
It was a most convenient dorm
I found a million dollar baby in a five and ten cent store
The rain continued for an hour
I hang around for three our four
Around a million dollar baby in a five an ten cent store
She was selling china
And when she made those eyes
I kept buying china until the crop got wise
Incidentally
If you should run into a shower
Just step inside my cottage door
And meet the million dollar baby from the five and ten cent store

(A million pieces)

I breathe in hard
Don't speak, 'cause it's like a bitter pill
You blow my mind, it makes my heart beat
(Harder, harder, harder, hard)
The king's a clown
No one is loving, it's not a drill
Don't look outside, the world is ending
(Faster, faster, faster, faster, fast)

The echoes of that news ring loud (The echoes, the echoes)
No sound can ever drown it out (The echoes)

It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into a million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into a million pieces
If it's gonna break me, won't you let me go?
Leave it 'til the morning, I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into a million pieces

(A million pieces)

We're too far gone
Nothing I say will mean anything
Just drink, fuck, dance right through disaster
I don't wanna talk about it now

The echoes of that news ring loud (The echoes, the echoes)
No music ever drowns it out (The echoes)

It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into a million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into a million pieces
If it's gonna break me, won't you let me go?
Leave it 'til the morning, I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into a million pieces

(A million pieces)

Get fear and loathing out of your mind
And don't pull me, don't pull me down from the ceiling...

It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart into a million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into a million pieces
If it's gonna break me, won't you let me go?
Leave it 'til the morning, I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into a million pieces

We're lying by the orange sky
Two million miles across the land
Scattered to the highest high
Expect they'll either laugh or cry
No sex, no consequence, no sympathy
You're good enough to heat

Two minute warning
Two minutes later
When time has come
My days are numbered

The dawning of another year
Marks time for those who understand
One in four still here
While you and I go hand in hand
No radio, no sound, no sin, no sanctuary
So welcome to your last

The sun, the solitude, the cemetary
So welcome to your last

Who had heaven and Earth
In the palm of his hand

Give me another chance

Oh if someone writes a song with a simple rhyme
Just a song where is feeling show
And if someone feels the same about the simple song
Oh sometimes you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also, it also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

Oh if someone plays piano with some simple chords
So melodic and endearing too
And oh if someone plays guitar with the old piano
And maybe you can hear them sing
Music gives you happiness or sadness
But it also heals your soul

Let the music heal your soul
Let the music take control
Let the music give you the power to move any mountain

Oh yeah
Let the music heal you soul
Let the music take control
Let the music heal you soul
Oh, oh yes

He left the splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me

And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly
Yeah if that isn't love
Then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love

Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
Then he spoke of love and compassion
And He took him to paradise

And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly
Yeah if that isn't love

Resuscitate
In my sleep
Awake to see
You're never here

But the losing yields
Another year
Facing hopes and fears

And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life

And the planes and trains
Are to blame
For tempting us
To refrain
And to cut the chord
Dis every word
Of the truths absurd

And I wish
I could believe there was more
Hopes suffocating
You've kissed my life

Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
Hopes suffocating
And you've kissed my life

Pretty  women
Fascinating
Sippin coffee
Dancing, pretty women
Pretty women
Are a wonder, pretty women
Sitting in the window or
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air
Pretty women
Silhouetted
Stay within you
Glancing stay forever
Breathing lightly, pretty women,
Pretty women
Blowing out their candles or
Combing out their hair
Even when they leave
They still are there
They're there
Sipping coffee
Here's to the ladies who lunch
Everybody Laugh
Lounging in their caftans and
Planning a brunch
On their own behalf
Off to the gym
Then to a fitting,
Claiming they're fat
And looking grim,
Cause they've been sitting
Choosing a hat
I'll drink to that!

Here's to the girls who just watch
Aren't they the best
When they get depressed,
It's a bottle of scotch
Plus a little jest!
Another chance to disapprove
Another brilliant zinger
Another reason not to move
Another vodka stinger
I'll drink to that!

Here's to the girls who play wife
Aren't they too much!
Keeping house but clutching a copy of ""Life""
Just to keep in touch
The ones who follow the rules
And meet themselves at the schools
Too busy to know that they're fools
Aren't they a gem!
I'll drink to them!
Let's all drink to...

Pretty women, fascinating
How they make a man sing...

**Here's to the girls on the go,
Everybody tries
Look into their eyes
And you'll see what they know,
Everybody dies
A toast to that invincible bunch
The dinosaurs surviving the crunch
Let's hear it for the ladies who lunch
Everybody rise
Everybody rise,

Pretty women at their mirrors
In their gardens
On committees, telephoning
Window shopping table hopping
Pretty women giving parties
Never stopping
Gossip swapping, capsule popping

Everybody rise, everybody rise,
Everybody rise, everybody rise-
Rise-rise-rise...
Pretty women rise!
