Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah.

Said you needed a ride, but you wanted my car
Without that face, girl, you wouldn't get far
I really like you, despite who you are (Who you are)
You see me on TV, you know I'm a star
You say you don't know me, but I know that's false
I'll pay the price, girl, whatever that cost (What it cost)

You make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off

I had a thousand bad times, so what's another time to me? (What's that to me?)
You tried to blow my house down, but what's another house to me? (What's that to me?)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (That you give)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave, I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)

And I don't wanna meet your mama (No)
She pro'lly crazier than you (She pro'lly crazier than you)
I'm gonna need some thicker armor (Armor)
To spend another night with you (And on and on and on)

Baby, I know just what to do
Every time you fuck me over, I come back to you
Baby, I don't wanna know the truth (Know the truth)
I ignore them when they tell me all the shit you do (Shit you do)
I always get my heart broke, like I needed the practice
Foot on my throat 'til my world is collapsing
Now this what I chose, it's the law of attraction, yeah (And on and on and on)

Now you make my life so hard
But that's what gets me off

I had a thousand bad times, so what's another time to me? (What's that to me?)
You tried to blow my house down, but what's another house to me? (What's that to me?)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (That you give)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave, I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)

I should get out, but I still want more
I should get out, what am I waiting for?

It's all the same to me
It's all a game to me
It's all the same to me
It's all the same

I had a thousand bad times, so what's another time to me? (What's that to me?)
You tried to blow my house down, but what's another house to me? (What's that to me?)
'Cause I can take anything that you give me (That you give)
It's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch
So thank you for the grave, I needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)

Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth
You can't come down to earth
You're swelling up, you're unstoppable

'Cause you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you

Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like it's a birth squeeze
And the love for what you hide
And the bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born

When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you

Que vais-je faire?
De tout ce temps
Que sera ma vie
De tous ces gens
Qui m'indifferent
Et maintenant
Que tu es parti

Pour qui?
Et ce matin qui revient pour rien
Mon coeur qui bat
Pourquoi?
Pour qui?
Qui bat trop fort, trop fort...
What now my love, now that it's over
I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars, tumbling around me
And there's the sky, where the sea should be
What now my love, now that you're gone
I'd be a fool to go on and on and on
No one would care, no one would cry
If I should live if I should live or die

Plus rien a faire
Je n'ai vraiment plus rien!

Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids
One, two, three
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
I think I'm in love with you

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, been running through my mind all day baby
'They all say I'm crazy, cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear what they say

'Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me

So what you're from the other side of the tracks,
So what the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us like when you fell from heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't even care nothing about it, babe
'Cause since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same.

I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me

So what you're from the other side of the tracks,
So what the world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here and let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

I told you I'm in love with that girl

I'm in love with that girl
So don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, oh, no, no
So don't be mad at me
I don't care

So what you're from the other side of the tracks?
So what the world don't think we match?
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what?
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me, that she's in love with me

I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
'Cause I'm in love with that girl

A punk'll jump up to get him a beat down
At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound
My flow all over the place, .44 in the waist
I'm so-so innovative, po-po in the way, I roll over 'em and make bacon
And call 'em a pig, won't you hop up off of my dick?
Words in the way, I'm at loss by him
I give you a JFK on the front lawn of MLK in the crossfire (Get down, nigga)
I have evolved into the lost diaries of the mob and the Rothschilds
(C'mon)
I feel like God broke the vials and I am just layin' down inside 'em like caulk and tile

Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal

Yo, snappin' necks plus I'm live, in effect
I'm in the Slick Rick eye patch, but I got it from Hex
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
For the god in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
They be like, You put the Thought on? Yikes
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I'm the king of the blood sport on mics
I'm from an era, you had beef? You prolly fist fought on sight
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-Illitant
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR
All my dogs is out the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (Keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call my youngins takin' flight
You a bark, bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo
Vespucci, I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmose the Third, with seven inch herringbones

Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal

Uh-uh, I survived it and that's a miracle

Better hope an ambulance is en route
Papers are hand grenades soon as I pull the pin out
I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
All combined into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
Here come me, 5-to-9 and Thought, da-dun, da-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist, tryna ball a fist I will
Fuck you just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving (What?), when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
Now here's to LL, Big L and Del
K-Solo, Treach and G Rap
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
Ed O.G. and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
King Tee, UTFO and Schoolly D, PE and BDP
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
From B.I.G. and Paris Three Times Dope and some we'll never see, and PRT
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
Without him, I don't know where I'd be

Man, here we go

My era, my era, my era so original

Yeah, girl
Can you hear that?
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy?
Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

You hear the beat as it makes you not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door. It's locked so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars: not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry. She smells like Tacos I wanna eat

Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet
With sugar plums
Oh, look, here comes Marshall! He's on your street!
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em
He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek

Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite Graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack The Ripper is all that I am

My music box
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love. You keep calling me
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
So when you call, I come, I will answer

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So, won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
And would you be my private little dancer?

I almost look comatose
Who wants to be sober gross?
I foam like a Doberman. Mouth open
I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size. Eyes are so bugged. I know

I put on my mother's make-up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder
I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devil's upset with his wife
They must be sluggin' it out

I must be buggin' the fuck out
But what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic. I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse
The sound of a music box comes from inside a toy chest
But what do I do? It's locked

I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
It's playing a song so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full. I smell a funeral. Guess I'll loom in the park

My music box
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love. You keep calling me
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
So when you call, I come, I will answer

'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So won't you twirl around, and do a whirl for me?
And would you be my private little dancer?

I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's neck like a Pixy Stix
The sick Satan-worshippin'
Bitches get horse-whippings
I'm in the back
Through the back door slipping through the crack
Leavin' the corpse drippin'

The mortician of love sent from above
Forced entry. The more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century I'm just numb
Am I dreamin'? Is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns

The time has come to tie her up
Gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter
Her brain matter
And batter
Her with the bat
A matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her

Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer. I'm back to ravish you
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula.

Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
Stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack. So, Pamela

My music box
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me

Just walking down the street
One cloudless sunny day
Just minding my business
Thinking my thoughts - nothing much to say
When suddenly I got hit
Imagine my surprise
Your smile came up and zapped me
Right between the eyes
I'd never seen anything to compare
With your smile
I'd never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Stuck in the traffic
Stuck at the lights
What do I see
Some stupid bimbo
In a fast car next to me
She takes off
Imagine my disgust
Like a bat outta hell
I get to eat her dust
I never known anything to compare
With her laugh
I never known anything
That counted by half
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart
Steal my heart

Hijack my heart
Hijack my heart

Look at the city
Look at the streets
What do you see?
Look at the faces
Look at the people
They all wonder me

Suddenly hit by something
They don't get to choose
It comes out of nowhere
Right out of the blue
'Cos I've never seen anything
To compare with your smile
I've never seen anything
That came within miles
My heart got hijacked by you

Hijack my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be
Stole my heart
Threw away the key
Ooh ee, baby what's become of me
You hijacked my heart
Now you really got a hold on me
You hijacked my heart
Don't you never let me be

Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful

Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace

Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed

Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door

It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble

Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you’re a bad influence, that’ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door

It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone

This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you’re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don’t see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that’s free in life is love
And that don’t come cheap

It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble

Scribbled in dark places,
Like notches on the belt... (they're chasing after you but...)

And dress me up,
In sucker love,
And drag me 'round,

So long and thanks for all,
The make believe,

Kicking and screaming...

The landscape is changing
The landscape is crying
Thousands of acres of forest are dying
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside

'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere
Just take good care of the world
I don't care if you're going nowhere
Just take good care of the world

Now we're re-arranging
There's no use denying
Mountains and valleys, can't you hear them sighing
Evolution, the solution or the certainty
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy

Token gestures, some semblance of intelligence
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance

That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you
To her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Sore was I from a crack of an enemy's hose
And the horrible sound of tomato

Ketchup
Soup and puree
Don't get left behind

When a rattle of rats had awoken
The sinews, the nerves and the veins
My piano was boldly outspoken
In attempts to repeat this refrain

So I stood with a knot in my stomach
And I gazed at that terrible sight
Of two youngsters concealed in a barrel

When she put me in a meditation states
Her skin was white, so white

There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me
When we raise hell I can't stay away

It circulates, you start to feel it (devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to invoke the spirits (got you on the floor)
She comes alive when you're the killing (hungry for some more)

[Hook:]
Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's the demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
[2x]
(It makes me say ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don't want to escape
All the other ones that have tried find out that they have made their final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type she told me that she found her perfect blood mate

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Rose me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna freak
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle
It feels like...
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle (candle...)
Sometimes it feels like...
Smells so funky.
Guitar

Give it to me
Break
Smells so good

[Hook]

[4x]
Give it to me
There goes the boogie, there goes the howl

Give it to me

[4x]
Start to think like an animal

Now that you got me
Tell me what you’re gonna do with me
I taste your blood
And found out you was the perfect fit
Come on
Show me what you’re working with
Come on mama
Go and show me what you’re working with
Show me what you’re working with

True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…
True blood… true blood…

Now that you got me
Tell me what you’re gonna do with me
‘Cause I can taste your blood
I found out you were my perfect fit
Come on mama
Show me what you’re working with
I said come on mama
Come on, show me what you’re working with

You got that (true blood)
We got that (true blood)
You got that (true blood)

El amor

I like to drink wine, and money is fine
But I like the girls even more
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor

Some pesos you pass, put wine in her glass
And soon she will say si senor
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor

With wine on your lips and money in your pocket
And your sweetheart in your arms
You're rich as you can be
So lift up your glass, let's sing it all together
Muchachas, caballeros, make this toast with me

We'll drink one more time, with money and wine
Let's drink to the girls we adore
Viva el vino, viva el dinero, viva viva el amor

Sing one more time, money and wine
Let's sing to the girls we adore

Across the ocean wild and wide

Since first, you were my bonny bride

The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft whenever you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eye

Oh, I will take you home, Kathleen
To where your heart shall feel no pain
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home, Kathleen

Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Man what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick a capella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus, my soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this

I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your woman just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MCs would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, and you's a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running past the gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance? No we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing but run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed your casket closed you still'll be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner than Jeru jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow follower singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

All seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And the hunger more profound
Well, I know there can come tears from the eyes
But they may as well all be in vain
Even though
I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

And the seas are full of water
That stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the poor

And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain

And I start loving you, wanting you

Where is all my self control?

And needing you

Wishing I could be the man I try to
Hating me for wanting to be with you
Knowing you don't love me like you used to
But it's midnight, oh, and I miss you

It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight

I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you

Les cicatrices et les blessures
Écrites dans le sable à la surface

Je suis la mère, tu es l'enfant
Aucun lien n'est plus fort
Tu es ma terre, moi l'océan
Tu es mon seul décor

Je sais devenir capricieuse
Je peux me mettre en sang
Et jouer la tempête furieuse
Qui te défend

De tout mon privilège
Mes vagues te protègent

Comme un enfant face à la mer
Souriant et apaisé
Tu trouves en moi quelques repères
Notre rêve est réalisé

Ne pleure plus, je te rassure
Car c'est la mer qui efface
Les cicatrices et les blessures
Écrites dans le sable à la surface

Comme un enfant face à la mer
Souriant et apaisé
Tu trouves en moi quelques repères
Notre rêve est réalisé

Ne pleure plus, je te rassure
Car c'est la mer qui efface
Les cicatrices et les blessures
Écrites dans le sable à la surface

Aren't you glad it's finally over
Don't  you feel a whole lot better?
Isn't it a joy to lie alone at night
Aren't  people more exciting?
Doesn't music have more meaning?
Don't you close your eyes
The moment you close the light
To be rid of all the feelings
How it clouded up the morning
To be free of all the memories
Everyone
Take a bow  then take another
Isn't loneliness a winner
'Cause you're leaving me
The best thing you've ever done
To be rid of all the feelings
How it clouded up the morning
To be free of all the memories
Everyone
Take a bow then take another
Isn't loneliness a winner
'Cause you're leaving me
The best thing you've ever done

In these moments, moments of our lives
All the world is ours
And this world is so right
You and I sharing this time together
Sharing the same dream
As the time goes by we will find

These are the special times
Times we'll remember
These are the precious times
The tender times we'll hold in our hearts forever
These are the sweetest times
These times together
And through it all, one thing will always be true
The special times are the times I share with you

With each moment, moment passing by
We'll make memories that will last all our lives
As you and I travel through time together
Living this sweet dream
And every day we can say

These are the special times
Times we'll remember
These are the precious times
The tender times we'll hold in our hearts forever
These are the sweetest times
These times together
And through it all, one thing will always be true
The special times are the times I share with you

These tender moments
When heaven is so close
These are the moments that I know

These are the special times
Times we'll remember
These are the precious times
The tender times we'll hold in our hearts forever
These are the sweetest times
These times together
And through it all, one thing will always be true
The special times are the times I share
Are the times we share, are the times I share... with you
Special times I share with you

She's got a target painted on her back,
And keeps a list of the qualities a good girl lacks.
She bites her lip and tips her bottle,
I take a drink 'cause the truth is hard to swallow.
Oh, oh, oh

Sex and white lies,
Handcuffs and alibis,
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps...
Her heart beats, red wine,
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on the pillow that used to be mine.
Oh, oh.

I live a lifestyle full of first impressions.
I've got my hands full of unhealthy obsessions.
She bites my lip, I'm sure to follow.
We take a drink to the guilty and the hollow.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Sex and white lies,
Handcuffs and alibis,
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps.
Her heart beats, red wine,
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on the pillow that used to be mine.

Oh, oh.
My toxic valentine,
Oh, oh.
My toxic valentine.

I'm not the type to forget or to bury my head.
Just take off your wings,
They could never get you quite as high as I did,
And you know it.

Sex and white lies,
Handcuffs and alibis,
She lays her halo on the pillow where she sleeps...
Her heart beats, red wine,
My toxic valentine.
Lays her halo on the pillow that used to be...

A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal

Criminal
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
Hate fags? The answer's yes

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfucking balls
You'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em

Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail.
Get it? Checking the 'male'?

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen. A-men!

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink more liquor
To fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word
My morals went ... when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me
You won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
The Maniac's in in place of the doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather
So I'm taking his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waiting on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
Aha?
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Go, go, go!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word
I just flip 'em the bird
And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind

And keep going, I don't take shit from no one

Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin

How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said hell yeah!
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man

Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'

'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too

You got me in your spell,
A hundred magic fingers
A swhirling carousel
The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing something
That I just can't describe

Ooh, and I can feel it,
Feel it, feel it, feel it

Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
Way down, down, way, way on down
Way on down

Hold me again,
As tight as you can
I need you so,
Baby, let's go

Way down where it feels so good
Way down where I hoped it would
Way down where I never could
Way down, down, way, way on down
Way on down, way on down

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-

If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me
What would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular
Tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
Like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
Saying I do

Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
What would you do?
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team
Tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure
That baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
Just saying I do

Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady

Alright it's time to get it JT
I don't know what she hesitates for man
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls real wild
Throw their hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I.
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high? Man
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady

She know what she want
She know how to move me
And she know when she wrong
That's why we break up
Break up, break up, only to
Make up, make up, make up
Why we fighting

That I wanna let go, wanna let go
But it's some 'bout that booty

Just want me to put you in that position
Make you say ohh no
And if you was ever missing
The thought of being with other niggas
I be like ohh no

If anything was to happen
You know I'll be the first to take action
For you
'Cause you still got a hold on me
Don't you

I fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up all my broken things
'Cause you left me, police tape, chalk line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
You're made up, dressed up, messed up
Plans I set in stone

But you made me do when I don't like
Dancing in the alley with the street rat nightlife
Can't keep living with a feeling that I'm giving up everything for you

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

Make a fool of myself when you hang around
When you're gone
I'm a match that's burning out
Could have been, should've done, what I said I was going to do
(Said that I would do)
But I never promised you
(But I never promised you, promised you)

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
It never took a fool to see the things that I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I do ya

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
('Cause you left me, police tape, chalk line)
That you were oh, oh, over me I think that I should go

No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like Gs, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell, Everybody get out!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways — do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a hand basket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window, Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', Get the cops, quick!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', Stop it!
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits

It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313

I was a loser then,
But I'm a winner now.
I'd do it all again,
'Cause now I know how.
How everything in life comes down to this, at last:
Surviving, and living,
Determined not to give in.

And I'm still alive.
My life is rolling on.
Gently, from day to day,
Memories will fade away.
Yes, I'm still alive.
The agony is gone.
My mind is slowly waking,
And my heart has ceased its aching.
I'm still alive.

I took so many blows.
(Took so many blows.)
I cried a sea of tears.
And only heaven knows
How I could stand the fears.
I think of all the nights I lay alone, and scared,
All shattered, and crying,
And thinking I was dying.

But I'm still alive.
My life is rolling on.
Gently, from day to day,
Memories will fade away.
Yes, I'm still alive.
The agony is gone.
My mind is slowly waking,
And my heart has ceased its aching.
I'm still alive.

Yes I'm still alive.
My life is rolling on.
Gently, from day to day,
Memories will fade away.
Yes, I'm still alive.
The agony is gone.

And my heart has ceased its aching.

Love that's pure hopes all things
Believes all things, won't pull no strings
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
Capture your heart and hold it for ransom

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure won't lead you astray
Won't hold you back, won't mess up your day
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It don't make you envious, it don't make you suspicious

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that's pure ain't no accident
Always on time, is always content
An eternal flame, quietly burning
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning

You don't want a love that's pure
You wanna drown love
You want a watered-down love

You don’t really love them
But, you really love when braid your hair and give in
You try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends it spins again

Oh, till it comes all this way just too broken heart
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
It’s alright, it’s alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There a place in your head for what doesn't
make sense, for the things you don’t get.
Look them up when you get it.
You can try to get in, but rejected again.
I feel off again, I guess so well.

Oh, till it comes all this way just too broken heart
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you don’t feel alright
It’s alright, it’s alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
you still love, too spend up time
Driving like a car in the moonlights out
Oh,we move side by side
Some times we play,we play alone
Examine love, freak face
Oh,it's good again

Oh, till it comes all this way just too broken heart
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you don’t feel alright

Who made the mountains, who made the trees
Who made the rivers flow to the sea
And who sends the rain when the earth is dry
Somebody bigger than you and I

Who made the flowers to bloom in the spring
Who made the song for the robins to sing
And who hung the moon and the stars in the sky
Somebody bigger than you and I

He lights the way when the road is long
He keeps you company
And with His love to guide you
He walks beside you
Just like He walks with me

When we're filled with despair
Who gives me courage to go from there
And who gives me faith that will never die
Somebody bigger than you and I

The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great

This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

I hope that it will stay

I make it half past six you come at seven
Always trying to keep me, hanging round
You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool, for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?

Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?

How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand

When I met you, you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were oh so so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive, you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?

2786,Bob Dylan,1976,Black Diamond Bay,Desire,"
_x000D_
Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that

And all of the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in

She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay.

As the morning light breaks open
The Greek comes down and he asks for a rope
And a pen that will write
Pardon monsieur the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
Am I hearing you right?

And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador

She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay.

A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man
Who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
Can you see anything?

Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says, Open up another deck.

But the dealer says, Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay.

The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around in the aftermath
And the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman's hand
Said, Here's a ring it cost a grand.
She said, That ain't enough.

Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read Do Not Disturb

She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay.

I've got to talk to someone quick!
But the Greek said, Go away, and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, Help there's danger near!
Please open up a-the door.

Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man
Were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love

But the desk clerk said, It happens every day.
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay.

As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank
In the gambling room
The dealer said, It's too late now.
You can take your money, but I don't know how
You'll spend it in the tomb.

The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
As the floor caved in
And the boiler in the basement blew
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her,
My darling je vous aime beaucoup.

She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay.

I was sitting home alone one night
In LA watching old Cronkite
On the seven o'clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of Greek shoes

Didn't seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear

And there's really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay.

When the sun shines, when the sun shines

Shine, the weather's fine

Everything's the same

The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost

We sat and made a list
Of all the things that we had
Down the backs of table tops
Ticket stubs and your diaries

I read them all one day
When loneliness came and you were away
Oh they told me nothing new,
But I love to read the words you use

These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire fire fire

I was the match and you were the rock
Maybe we started this fire
We sat apart and watched
All we had burned on the pyre

And we sure as hell have nothing now
(You said) we were born with nothing
And we sure as hell have nothing now

Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no-one can harm me
They just stare at me and wonder why
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind

See me sitting in the palmtree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind

Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please

See me sitting in the palmtree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No-one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please

Ain't gonna go to hell for anybody...

I can manipulate people as well as anybody.
Hold 'em and control 'em, squeeze 'em and tease 'em.
I can make believe I'm in love with almost anybody.
Force 'em and burn 'em, twist 'em and turn 'em.
All that satisfies the fleshy needs.
I've been down that road, I know what it needs.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!

I can persuade people as well as anybody.
I got the vision, but it caused division.
I can twist the truth as well as anybody.
I know how to do it, I've been all the way through it.
But it don't suit my purpose and it ain't my goal
to gain the whole world, but give up my soul.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for brother, no way!

I can twist the truth around as well as anybody.
Wine 'em and dine 'em, fool 'em and rule 'em.
I can rob and steal from people as well as anybody.
I know how to do it, but it don't suit my purpose and it ain't my goal
to gain the whole world but give up my soul.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not for father, not for mother, not for sister, not for brother, no way!

Smoke arises for ever, on a one-way ticket to burn.
A place reserved for the devil
and for all those that done evil.
A place of darkness and shame, you can never return.

I can influence people as well as anybody.
I can cause division, can cause division.
I can mislead people as well as anybody.
Burn 'em and roll 'em, rob 'em and hold 'em.
Won't get my story in tricks or cards.
I can see through man's delusions, I can see through his facades.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!

I can write and steal from people as well as anybody.
Know all the devices, paid a lot of prices,
I can influence people as well as anybody.
Go right up to 'em, I know how to do 'em.
Don't need to depend on tricks or on cards.
I can see through man's delusions, I can see through his facades.

But I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody,
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
I ain't gonna go to hell for anybody.
Not today, not tonight, not tomorrow, no never, no way!

That I know that I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery

Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

What the hell?

Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell

Closing in

And bury our love in a shallow grave

And you're my four leaf clover

Heavy as ever, light as a feather

Hard to stay focused, process the progress
How long can we be
Happy if happy ain't meant for us
Cause being less ain't good enough
But being us feels good to us

And bury our love in a shallow grave

I don't fuck with birds, but you bitches on my cock though
If I want some chicken and waffles I go to Roscoe's
Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer
Fuckin' with my baby, I'm a gunna
When I say baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout Stunna
I'm talking 'bout lil' like Weezy on the come-up (Uh)

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard

I, I, I...
How am I gonna get myself back home?
I, I, I...

We are the last people standing
At the end of the night
We are the greatest pretenders
In the cold morning light

This is just another night
And we've had many of them
To the morning we're cast out
But I know I'll land here again

How am I gonna get myself back home?
I, I, I...
How am I gonna get myself back home?
I, I, I...

There's a light in the bedroom
But it's dark
Scattered around on the floor are
All my thoughts

This is just another night
And we've had many of them
To the morning we're cast out
But I know I'll land here again

How am I gonna get myself back home?
I, I, I...
How am I gonna get myself back home?
I, I, I...

The birds are mocking me
They call to be heard
The birds are mocking me
They curse my return

How am I gonna get myself back home?

Oh, how am I gonna get myself back home?

You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain 'til it hurts
You've taken all my money, and you want more

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies
Who are fools of the first division

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart
Of your own

Kill joy, bad guy
Big talking, small fry
You're just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy
To replace me?
Can you face me?

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good. Are you satisfied?
Do you feel like suicide?
I think you should
Is your conscience all right?
Does it plague you at night?
Do you feel good, feel good?

Talk like a big business tycoon
You're just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
You're just an overgrown school boy
Let me tan your hide

Dog with disease
You're the king of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Know-All
Was the fin on your back part of the deal, shark?

Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart
You never did

You're a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride

Should be made unemployed

And I saw her standin' there.

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)
And I saw her standin' there.

Well, my heart went boom,
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)
Since I saw her standing there

There's a ghoul beneath the bed

Now it's coming down the stairs

Then there's spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose taunting me
You're warning me
To be the stranger in your life

Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast you visualised

And if you wanna see
Eccentricities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialise

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh

You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby

There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there

There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin that lay open
Where a restless soul has spoken

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you've come to see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes

A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night

But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you

So tell me is it scary for you baby
Tell me
So tell me is it really for you baby
Am I scary for you

You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you

Masquerade the heart
Is it the height of hurting souls
I'm just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you baby

So tell me am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you baby
Am I scary for you

I don't wanna talk about it

And mark a place in time for every chance you took?
Don't get me wrong,
I know you've got your life in place
I've yet to take the hint, someday
I'm sure I'll get the picture
And stop waiting up

The remains of my wasted youth?

Shaking in waiting for something more

And there's money on the table
That says your cheap shots won't be able
To break bones
I've yet to break a sweat
I'll make your past regret it's future

For more than just a moment of truth between the lies told
To pull ourselves away from the lives we leave back

And make a fear for dream all right
By grinning ear to ear

He sets his mind to do

If he really wanted to
My Pa can sweeten up a day
That clouds and rain make gray
And tell me funny stories
That will chase the clouds away
My Pa's the only one on Earth
I can tell my troubles to
His arms are house and home to me
His face's a pretty poem to me

Could know him too...

I never have a care
All night I'm so light
I walk right on the air

Oh let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you

Whenever I feel those pretty arms
Reaching round about
That feeling goes to my toes
And all the lights go out, go out, go out

Whenever I see those eyes of blue
Smiling up so shy
I'm in such a spin I take right off and fly

So let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you

So let me dance in the arms I love
Thrill me through and through
I'm so drunk with love
That all I see is you

I never hear the music play

Dancing on a cloud

Riad and the Bedouins had a plan and thought they'd win
But I don't give a fuck 'bout them 'cause I am crazy

Oh, my salvation and all my frustrations
Caught in the lies, no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh

Riad and the Bedouins and that's a war that you can't win
But I have had enough of them and who blame me
Sands of time and desert winds, Nomads and Barbarians
I won't bend my will to them, you aggravate me

Oh, my salvation and all my frustrations
Caught in the lies, no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell
Ooh, sweet salvation, like all my frustrations
Caught up in lies, no one had wove as well
Somewhere in time where only I could tell, ooh

Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
That will love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
So sail away sweet sister
Because I'll always be in love with you

But let her be somebody else's queen
I don't want to know about you
Because too many others know what I mean
And that's why I got to live without you

I'm in love with a girl
Been talking about
I'm in love with a girl
That I can't live without
I'm in love but it feels like
I'm living it out
I'm in love but I think I picked a bad time

4977,Eminem,2013,Beautiful Pain(Deluxe Edition Bonus Track),The Marshall Mathers LP 2,"

[Eminem and Sia:]
I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause

[Sia:]
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Eminem:]
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed
So focused on the bright side
Then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast the more asserted
Never looking back
May hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to
To avert a disaster
Lucky no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant

[Sia:]
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Eminem:]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
'Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep 'cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
'Cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

As time passes
Things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same
But tomorrow today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
From the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

[Sia:]
I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standin' in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Dreaming you will find me

Feels so good I want to cry

But then the first to leave
And I have missed you so heavily
But the weight's kind of lifting

And though I might have been lonely, you're lost
I don't feel like giving up just because you climbed off

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step off this road is not the end

Was just a moment, no souvenirs
No ink in my shoulder, but honey you were here
And I know love wins over pride
I won't out stay my welcome, but love is on my side

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step off this road is not the end

And I know we said forever
And I know you left your mark
But you gave me a life worth leaving

And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger

There's something you're not saying
Baby I'm scared

You let me come back home

Mem'ries,
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures,
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we? Could we?
Mem'ries, may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember...
The way we were...
The way we were...

If you were the Mona Lisa
You'd be hanging in the Louvre
Everyone would come to see you
You'd be impossible to move

It seems to me it's what you are
A rare and priceless work of art
You stay behind your velvet rope
But I will not renounce all hope

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible

From the moment I first saw you
All the darkness turned to light
An impressionistic painting
Tiny particles of light

It seems to me it's what you're like
The look, but please don't touch me type
And honestly, it can't be fun
To always be the chosen one

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece
'Cause after all
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible
Nothing's indestructible

And I'm right by your side
Like a thief in the night
I stand in front of the masterpiece

I stand in front of the masterpiece
And I can't tell you why
It hurts so much
To be in love with the masterpiece

No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Fold my hands and pray for rain

That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's fifty-four
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They say, Sing while you slave, and I just get bored

Sometimes when I'm mad 
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad
Sometimes when I scream
There's a voice in me that says, You shouldn't be so mean
Oh no, oh no
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde

We're like sun and rainy weather
Sometimes we're a hit together
Me and I
Gloomy moods and inspiration
We're a funny combination
Me and I
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique
Think about yourself for a minute
And you'll find the answer in it
Everyone's a freak

Sometimes I have toyed
With ideas that I got from good old Dr. Freud
Nothing new of course
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors
Oh no, oh no
I just wanna say a lot of that applies to me
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity

We're like sun and rainy weather

Well, I quit my job down at the car wash,
Left my mama a goodbye note,
By sundown I'd left Kingston,
With my guitar under my coat,
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis,
Got a room at the YMCA,
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights,
Just lookin' for a place to play,
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire,
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man.

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis,
I run outta money and luck,
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia,
On a overloaded poultry truck,
I thumbed on down to Panama City,
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars,
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar,
Makin' music on my guitar,
I got the same old story at them all night piers,
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son

So I slept in the hobo jungles,
Roamed a thousand miles of track,
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama,
At a club they call Big Jack's,
A little four-piece band was jammin',
So I took my guitar and I sat in,
I showed 'em what a band would sound like,
With a swingin' little guitar man.
Show 'em, son

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean,
Find yourself down around Mobile,
Make it on out to a club called Jack's,
If you got a little time to kill,
Just follow that crowd of people,
You'll wind up out on his dance floor,
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group,
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico,
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band,
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man.

[The TV-special verse:]
Well, I came a long way from the carwash,
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really ain't  got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm gonna get myself back on the track
I'll never, never ever look back
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I' m a swinging little Guitar man

All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away

Ev'ry single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Still the old heart's young enough to say

It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
Truly lovely, wasn't it?

As the night time bleeds into the day
Tomorrow spills across the sky
And the sun's a harsh reminder why
We are feeling barely human

We don't know what's good for us
'Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won't discover 'til we push it

I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
'Cause the devil's got my arms
('Cause the devil's got my arms)
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away
Away, oh it grips me
'Cause the devil's got my arms
'Cause the devil's got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark

We got drunk on this unholy wine
To deliver us from our old minds
A promise of a better time
'Til we're feeling barely human

We don't know what's good for us
'Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won't discover 'til we push it

'Cause the devil's got my arms

Thank you
Thank you for comin' out tonight

I am the president of Dirty Money Records
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
New York City

Who you know fresher than Nick'? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn, but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go Ew?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl

And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall

And everything's spinning

Are swimming in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes
That bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches

You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up

Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it

And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place
I'm outta place
I'm in outer space
I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place
Now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's cube
17 years later I'm as rude as Jude
Scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs

I've got no game
And every face looks the same
They've got no name
So I don't need game to play

I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want

However I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standing next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you

But you're on it too
So you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like
Yo, what the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch
You know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you

But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now
I'm going to try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life
Live it however you wanna
Marijuana is everywhere
Where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're going
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning

But you're young
You've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw
Parties to crash
Sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
Did better drugs and updated
But I've still got a lot of growing up to do
I've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew

But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories
With a bottle of Jack
Two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Someone keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me

'Cause every time I try to tell them No
They won't let me ever let them go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

Drugs really got a hold of me
Really got a hold of me
'Cause drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me

4985,Eminem,2014,Guts Over Fear,compilation: Shady XV,"

[Eminem:]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Eminem:]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called Hi, My Name Is dropped

Started thinkin' my name was Fault
'Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog

Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught

Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off

You keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they're gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah

Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to

[Sia:]
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)

An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Eminem:]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Eminem:]
I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on

But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit harder
Shit-learned how to harness it while the reins were off

And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art

And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?

And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen 'cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun

So to the break of dawn
Here I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make Not Afraid 2
Than make another motherfucking We Made You, uh

And I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt

'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just havin' to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania
So when they empty that stadium
'Least I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done

So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off

The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was a

[Sia:]
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found (my dream)
I don't wanna go another round (but I won't)

An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (might shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear

You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman
I'm not a king, just a man, take my hand
We'll make a space in this lives that we planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go

Yes, we're different worlds apart, we're not the same
We laughed and played at the start like in a game, oh Lord
You could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay until it's time for you to go

Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
Lord love me, love me, love me, love me now

This love of mine has no beginning, it has no end
I was an oak now I'm a willow and I can bend
And tho' I'll never in my life see you again
Here I stay until it's time for you to go

Oh yes, I'll stay until it's time for you to go

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear.
I've seen that road before,
It always leads me here, lead me your door
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road.
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
Don't keep me waiting here,
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Don't leave me waiting here (don't keep me waiting)
Let me know the way

Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
Gotta tell your story sometimes, you know

Seemed like yesterday I was a baby on the street
I took a Holiday, I was stepping to the beat
I had to pay my rent on the Lower East Side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got Into the Groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered 

I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered

Ooooooooo
I came, I saw, I conquered
Ooooooooo
I came, I saw, I conquered

I Expressed myself, came Like a Virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass and I did it with a smile
And when it came to S.E.X. I know I walked the Borderline
And when I struck a pose all the Gay Boys lost their minds

I Justified My Love, I made you say a little Prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I Opened up my Heart, I learned The Power Of Goodbye
I saw a Ray of Light, Music saved my life

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered 

I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered

Ooooooooo
I came, I saw, I conquered
Ooooooooo
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Nas:]
In 1994, I came through the door
With that raw beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolinas
Pops from Natchez
In QB is where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops gon' kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl
Then I got married happily of course
Then that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule or too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, Imma ride
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trappers, any rapper
Any politician, beautician or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tossers either dead or jail
Not many option on the block I came from
And I turned to world rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I'm goin' right back to the block I came from
One

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered 

I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered

Gave me life under calico skies

I will hold you for as long as you like

Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the innermost secrets we hide

I'll hold you for as long as you like
I'll hold you for the rest of my life

Long live all of us crazy soldiers
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
Hey, and it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

I'm from a city where the rain won't sleep
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke
Gets your head into a muddle like
Walking into elephants
Syringes in a puddle like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nose dives
Can't resort to arrogance
With white lies
This city wants to raise me
But I can't help but see just
How this dark city changed me
It's all the same see
Music is my life but
Now I try to fight
Whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West
London's my home now
Knees weak but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
I'll stay away from all the negative shit
That will follow me

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

Londonderry bird
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word
I hear a breeze
A river Shannon breeze
It well may be it's followed me across the seas
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny Cove
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that laddie with the twinklin' eye
Come whistling by?
And does he walk away
Sad and dreamy there
Not to see me there?

So I ask each weeping willow
And each brook along the way
And each lad that comes a whistling
'Toora-lay'
How are things in Glocca Morra
This fine day?

The mist of May is in the gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'
Through the heather on the hill

The mornin' dew is blinking yonder
There's lazy music in the rill
And all I want to do is wander
Through the heather on the hill

There may be other days as rich and rare
There may be other springs as full and fair
But they won't be the same, they'll come and go
But this I must know

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that laddie calling 'toora-lay'?
Will we meet in Glocca Morra

As much as I hate you

This is music to be murdered by

Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm

Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated, the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee

They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by

When my rainbow turns the clouds away

And my blue moon again will turn to gold

Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now
What happened?
What do I remind you of?
Your past? Your dreams?
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why 'cause you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is gonna take my place

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?

Don't break my heart
Waiting for you

With a message at the local bird and bee

Do you wake up very slowly?
Does it take a while before you smile
Are your dreams like premonitions
Have you lived them through
Some people do
I hope you'll answer me with patient eyes
No hurried words, foolish or wise
Answer me, answer me with soft silent touches
They'll tell me as much as I need to know
Answer me with deep and restful sleeping
And if you dream in sleep
They're yours to keep
No you need not answer me
If we must part
Should someone ask
Who's touched your heart
Perhaps you'll answer me

'Bout a ghost from a wishing  well

With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost

That kind the drugstores sell
When you reach the part
Where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
The heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets spurned in a three way script
Ends up number two
The movie queen to play the scene
A bringing all the good things out in me
But for now, love, let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way
And I got to say
That I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling's gone
And I just can't get it back...

Season to season, we'll always have a reason
To be the best of friends that we can be
Someone you can turn to (I'll turn to you)

Warm memories to hold on to
That will never fade away

Sometimes, if you're lucky
You find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world

Life can be so cruel

With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him (Oooh)
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it)
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see

Oooh
I love him (Then show him)
Of that much I can be sure (Hold him close to you)
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Your faith will lead love where it has to go

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Never let him go

Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit!

If I could just put it all into all I spit
Instead of always trying swallow it
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it shit!

All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw
That's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic

I'm like a skillet bubblin', until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this building up, I've been sealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up

The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts!
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, Imma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
If you don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch

Peel the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah Imma make your hair sit up, yeah sit up
Imma tell you who I be, Imma make you hate me, cause you ain't me

You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you close-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me

You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line, but sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feeling at that time, yes
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

It's just sometimes it's always me
How dark can these hallways be
The clock strikes midnight
1, 2, then half past 3
This half-assed rhyme, with this half-assed piece of paper

I'm desperate at my desk
If I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest, again
Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothing
Fuck, I'm stumped, oh, wait, here comes something, nope!

It's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw this shit out
I'm fizzling out, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out

I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave
To this Trade ? Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up, want me to flip it? I can rip it
Any style you want

Imma switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
Imma sit here till I get enough of me to finally hit a fucking boiling point
Put some oil in your joints, flip the coin, bitch come get destroyed

An MC's worst dream, I make them tensed, they hate me
See me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em you would swear that Jaws was coming
By the screams of 'em you would swear I'm sawing someone

By the way they runnin', you would swear the law was coming
It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothing
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest

I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock! Imma make them eat this watch
Don't believe me watch! Imma win this race
And Imma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch!

I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it, rabbit run!

Tramplin' through the mud

Same spirit dwellin' in you
That raised Christ from the dead
You can quicken your mortal body
Then let it run to your head

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down (cover down, break through)

May need protection
By the armour of the Lord
The sword of God is sharper
Than any double sided sword

Cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down (cover down, break through)

Well, you wake up early in the mornin'
Turnin' from a-side to side
Somethin' givin' you a warning
You can run but you can't hide
Demands are laid upon you
And burdens a-you can't bear
Sins you can't even remember

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, cover down, break through

You've got an image of yourself
You've built by yourself alone
But it will come a-tumblin' down
Just like the walls are made of stone
You will be separated
From everything you seem to be
You think you'll be liberated
Yeah, but the grave won't set you free

You've got to cover down, cover down, break through
Cover down, cover down, break through

(Cover down, cover down, break through)
(Cover down, cover down, break through)

(Cover down, break through)

Mem'ries,
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures,
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we? Could we?
Mem'ries, may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember...
The way we were...
The way we were...

Right hand high, never tell a lie.

Y-Y-Your Honor, I didn't know that I hurt her
I didn't know she was crying
I didn't know that it was killing me slow
And-And your honor, she can't say I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't try
But I guess my love wasn't good enough

I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail

For that)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)

Your Honor, she accused me of cheating
It was all in her thinking
She gon' believe what she want to
So what the hell am I gon' do?
Turn my life around, it ain't going down
She knew 'bout the life that I live, why she crying now?
This shit is so silly to me, but I won't plead that

I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love

It don't matter 'cause to her, I'm guilty)

Let's go, right hand to the sky, strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case, well, what am I?
If I hurt her, I ain't try to, the club I may decide to
Ride through, she got proof? Well, I got alibis too
A couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
Seven-carat solitaire, Caribbean, water blue
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera, and the Bentley Coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to?
And her life, I submit to you as evidence, I never been on bullshit
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit
Knew what I expected when she met me, should have left me then
Balling against the law? Shorty, go on and arrest me then

5537,Madonna,1992,Secret Garden,Erotica,"
_x000D_
In my secret garden, I'm looking for the perfect flower
Waiting for my finest hour
In my secret garden, I still believe after all
I still believe and I fall
You plant the seed and I'll watch it grow
I wonder when I'll start to show
I wonder if I'll ever know
Where my place is
Where my face is
I know it's in here somewhere
I just wish I knew the color of my hair
I know the answer's hiding somewhere
In my secret garden, there's

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

If I wait for the rain to kiss me and undress me
Will I look like a fool, wet and a mess?
Will I still be thirsty?
Will I pass the test?
And if I look for the rainbow, will I see it
Or will it pass right by
Because I'm not supposed to see
Because the blind are never free
Even at my secret garden
There's a chance that I could harden
That's why I'll keep on looking, for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

I still believe, I still believe
Because after all is said and done
I'm still alive
And the boots have come and trampled on me
And I'm still alive
Because the sun has kissed me, and caressed me
And I'm strong, and there's a chance
That I will grow, this I know
So I'm still looking for

A petal that isn't torn
A heart that will not harden
A place that I can be born
In my secret garden
A rose without a thorn
A lover without scorn

Somewhere in Fontainebleau
Lies my secret garden

It's been a while since we've been alone
So turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while
And I apologise

I just get caught up in the rat race I'm running
Chasing a moment I'm hoping is coming
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darling, that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward
But not tonight
Love in slow motion

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves
And I apologise

Sometimes you're sad and you tell me it's nothing
And I brush it off because there's always something
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritise, -ise

There's one thing I know, it's this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward
But not tonight
Love in slow motion

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

Love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward
But not tonight
Love in slow motion

Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
In slow motion
In slow motion

You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
such a long long way
such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day

I'm sorry I don't wanna take a walk with ya
Matter of fact, I ain't tryna talk to ya
We ain't got no business, so fuck we talking for?
There ain't no need to bring me in for no interrogation
'Cause about that boy who just got shot, I got no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving
At the precinct writing statements on which trap house is the station (Damn)
Not I, tattle-telling is for homos
Besides, that's the Number 1 Young Money no-no
Police, we don't chat with them
We ain't got no rap for them
You in the cop car pointing niggas out from the back of them (There he go)
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I'm black, then you's a fucking goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the halfway house and ask your supervisor

Excuse me! Lemme get that brewski
Niggas know them bitches can't do it like I dooski
I just pull up, chuck the deuce in some blue denim
And I just heard you running with the lieutenant
I'm the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia
Yes, uh huh, Washington
Better ask around, 'cause I'm what's popping-ton
I'm who they think about, playing with they pee pee

Young Money psycho, straitjacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn to informant

So I'ma bring you to the bottom of the ocean
Uh, church, I hear you preaching like a fucking reverend
Should've killed you in the first place, no second guessing
Could've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck 'em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect 'em, I could AK or tech 'em
Ay, you looking at a gangster in his essence
Now, bitch, bow down when a gangster in your presence
'Cause I'm God's gift like a present
For one, don't try me I could give you two lessons
You peasants get murdered if you do test 'em

5519,Madonna,1990,More,I'm Breathless,"
_x000D_
Once upon a time I had plenty of nothin'
Which was fine with me
Because I had rhythm, music, love
The sun, the stars, and the moon above
Had the clear blue sky and the deep blue sea
That was when the best things in life were free

Then time went by and now I got plenty of plenty
Which is fine with me
'Cause I still got love, I still got rhythm
But look at what I got to go with 'em

Who could ask for anything more?
I hear you query
Who could ask for anything more?
Well, let me tell you, dearie

Got my diamonds, got my yacht
Got a guy I adore
I'm so happy with what I got
I want more!
Count your blessings, one, two, three
I just hate keeping score
Any number is fine with me
As long as it's more
As long as it's more!

I'm no mathematician
All I know is addition
I find counting a bore
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting
(More! More!)

I got rhythm, music too
Just as much as before
Got my guy and my sky of blue
Now, however, I own the view
More is better than nothing, true
But nothing's better than more, more, more
Nothing's better than more

One is fun, why not two?
And if you like two, you might as well have four
And if you like four, why not a few?
Why not a slew more?
(More! More!)

If you've got a little, why not a lot?
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle
Every jot and tittle adds to the pot
Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle
(More! More!)

Never say when, never stop at plenty
If it's gonna rain, let it pour
Happy with ten, happier with twenty
If you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many
Much more?

Or does that sound too greedy?
That's not greed, no, indeedy
That's just stocking the store
Gotta fill your cupboard
You remember Mother Hubbard
(More! More!)

Each possession you possess
Helps your spirits to soar
That's what's soothing about excess
Never settle for something less
Something's better than nothing, yes!
But nothing's better than more, more, more
(Except all, all, all)
Except all, all, all
Except once you have it all (have it all)
You may find all else above (find all else above)
That though things are bliss
There's one thing you miss
And that's more! More!
More! More! More! More!
More! More! More!

And you’ll never know it was easy
It won’t help pretending that we’ll stay close
I can’t help thinking that
I try to pretend that it’s your loss
And I never know, oh I’ll never know if it will work

There’s no better time
She’s still thinking I’m too far away
Understanding why she’s not thinking I’m a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today

Come Sunday I’ll see that one day you’ll rescue me 
And when I leave again I’ll feel strange
And I’ll never know, oh I’ll never know if you’re in love again
I can’t stop being a fool for you
I won’t help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I’ll never know, oh I’ll never know if I’m in love

There’s no better time

3098,Bob Dylan,,Walls Of Red Wing,,"
_x000D_
Oh, the age of the inmates
I remember quite freely:
No younger than twelve
No older 'n seventeen
Thrown in like bandits
And cast off like criminals
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall
Too weary to talk
And too tired to sing
Oh, it's all afternoon
You remember your hometown
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire
Stay far from the fence
With the 'lectricity sting
And it's keep down your head
And stay in your number
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, it's fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon
Farewell to the boardwalk
That takes you to the screen
And farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

It's many a guard
That stands around smilin'
Holdin' his club
Like he was a king
Hopin' to get you
Behind a wood pilin'
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows
And the wind punched hard
To make the wall-siding sing
It's many a night
I pretended to be a-sleepin'
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunkhouse shingles
And the sounds in the night
They made my ears ring
'Til the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, some of us'll end up
In St. Cloud Prison
And some of us'll wind up
To be lawyers and things
And some of us'll stand up
To meet you on your crossroads
From inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Feels like flying

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right

'Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh I love the way you lie

Hold my hand while you cut me down
It'd only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
When I fell off your mind

Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back

Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

J'ai couru après lui

Lui ouvrir les bras

Que toujours on le trouve auprès des siens

Est-il ici, dans ma maison
Ou à l'autre bout du monde
Est-il changeant comme le saisons
Peut-il revenir en une seconde
Ces questions je me les suis posé

Mais au fond j'avais toutes les réponses
Au bout des doigts

In my lexicon of hate
I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?

The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm

The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes

You’re feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I’d drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs

But all I do is fall over
I don’t have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes

I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet
You’re more man than I
To be dead to have no feeling
To be dry and spermless like a girl

I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife

Spermless like a girl

And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah
We all get too much

Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a

Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much, much

Who are you now?
Are you still the same or
Did you change somehow?
What do you do at this very moment
When I think of you
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it, can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you, I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
Yeah, I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last!)

I try to fight it, can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you, I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel (feel you) like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you (no, no!)

I wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go, oh-oh-oh!

Talk reckless, comin' for your neck, no strep throat

Yeah I make the rules, I ain't following a dress code
I don't do the mess though, I'ma put a hex though

Peekin' out the window, but they'll never win though

If you want to talk you can call
And no, it's not your fault.
I just smiled and said, Let go of me.
Now there's something I've just got to know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said, It's not my fault.

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah-yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been, oh then my heart

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true (true)
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious (mysterious)
When the one you want doesn't want you (want you)

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head
When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk, give me a call.

Heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true

My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics.
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is Destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

Picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me 
Keepin it real, and even if I do conceal

See niggaz is false, sittin in court, turned snitches 
that used to be real, but now they petrified bitches 
I'm tryin to be strong, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone, Bitches be warned.
word is bonb, you'll get torn
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggaz wrong 
And then it's on, before I leave picture me 
I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free 
Watch me set it, niggaz don't want it, you can get it

I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)

Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak

You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one
Never forget, night that we met, you had another one
You did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one

Is it just me or (Just me, baby)
Did our talks get a little bit shorter?
Is it just me or (Just me, baby)
Did the night get a little bit colder?
When that argument got vulgar
When it should've just blown over
It was nothing, nothing (Oh)

Is it just, just me?
(Oh, is it just me?)
Oh, is it just, just me?
(I been standing, waiting, gazing up)
Is it just, just me?
(You know, you know, you know, you know that)
Is it just, just me?
(I been waiting for you, baby, until now)

Is it just me? Is it, is it?
Is it just me? Is it, is it?

Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I can't do to you
I can take you higher
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my soul

At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the
Middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh, I'm on fire

Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love

From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain...

Lets talk about love
Lets talk about us
Lets talk about life
Lets talk about trust
Lets talk about love

It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - 'til the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

Lets talk about love - it's all were needin'
Lets talk about us - it's the air we're breathin'
Lets talk about life - I wanna know you
Lets talk about trust - and I wanna show you
Lets talk about love

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you
(it's no good unless she needs you...)
All the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years
(for all those years)
Come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say

But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

Then I heard you were at the bar and that you've been drinking since 3
So I hopped into my car and I drove down just to see
If you might want to talk about it, said you can always talk to me
If you're not ready to open up then I can stay here
Until the Sun comes up and it's alright if you had too much, if you had too much

Time has a way of changing everything
That goes for almost anything but us
Always have and I always will remain
Words from a heart that you can trust

While others come and go
You can always know
I'm here for you
Whenever you might need me

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

You're still sweet as a honeybee, after all these years
And you'll always be that funny girl to me
Season to season we'll always have a reason
You mean, to be the best of friends that we can be

Someone you can turn to (I turn to you)
Every minute of the day
Warm memories to hold on to
That will never fade away

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

You're like a sweet familiar song
A good book when I'm alone
A cup of coffee when I'm cold
A country road that leads me home

Sometimes if you're lucky
You'll find that certain someone
You can always count on to be true
If I had the choice of only one friend in this world
You know that I'd want to be you

Until I make it home again
I thank God he gave me you
We'll stay the way we were forever true
There's no one in this world that's been
A better friend to me than you

Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break
Held me under hoping I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away, tryna find my way out
Find my way out

And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For heaven's sakes, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up ten hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothing left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I been sipping forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone

Love
Shorty gone back
Need it on sight
Crack it all back
Give her that pipe
All of my gang
Shorty went bad

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

Why don't you

Take what you need from me

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks

I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I'll follow your casket
On a pale afternoon

I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do
'Cause saying I love you
Has nothing to do with meaning it

And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember
The way we used to melt
Do you remember how it felt
When I touched you
Oh 'cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you

And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you

Precious angel, under the sun
How was I to know you'd be the one
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon ?

Now there's spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down
Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief and there ain't neutral ground
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe ?

Shine you light, shine your light on me
Shine you light, shine your light on me
Shine you light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see.

My so called friends have fallen under a spell
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, Well all is well'
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die.

Sister, lemme tell you about a vision that I saw
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed in the same breath
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminal's death.

Shine you light, shine your light on me
Shine you light, shine your light on me
Shine you light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see.

Precious angel, you believe me when I say
What God has given to us no man can take away
We are covered in blood girl, you know our forefathers were slaves
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.

You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight
You're the lamb of my soul, girl, and you touch up the night 
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgement hall of Christ.

Shine you light, shine your light on me
Shine you light, shine your light on me
Shine you light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see.

[Eminem]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,
but he keeps on forgettin what he wrote down,
the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking now, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't

[Amy Lee]
My God my tourniquet
return to me salvation
my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation 

[Eminem]
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum

[Amy Lee]
My God my tourniquet
return to me salvation
my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

My wounds cry for the grave
my soul cries for deliverance
will I be denied Christ

Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptation so
Now won't you tell me

Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord

Life here is grand with friends I love so dear
Comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face that chilling hand of death
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord

Where could I go but to the Lord
Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord

Bitter sweet thing.
Could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain.
A tall shot of pain.
Pour a little OUT now for the love that we've made.

I feel it in the morning.
You’re still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone
Telephone a doctor: I’m not okay.
The bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Don’t change the truth.
I dive in but I can’t.

I can’t drink you away.
I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim,
I’ve tried all of their friends.
But I can’t drink you away.
All these rocks
I can’t swim
Out of this skin
I'm living in.
Say

Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break, ooh?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heart break?

Got a pounding on my brain.
So I drowned it away.
When the sun comes up tomorrow you can find me doing the same.
'Cause I just can’t forget
The way we turned out this bad/bed.
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead.

And then I feel it in the morning.
You’re still here in the morning.
I see you but you're gone.
Telephone a doctor: I’m not okay.
Bottom of the bottle
To fill this empty heart up.
A thousand proof
Don’t change the truth.
I dive in but I can’t.

If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind

And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down, I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now

You fooled me twice with your lies and I say

Does she know that my destiny lies with her

Waking up to a kiss and you're on your way
I'd really hoped that you would stay
But you left and went your own way

Besides sit around and wait for you
Oh and I hope you do too

You fooled me once with your eyes now honey

And it's killing me inside
Consuming all my time

And when I think I'm right
You strip away my pride
You cast it all aside but I say

Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid

I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down

I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed
I had things more important to do

I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down

Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me
If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me

If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
But if a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down

The desire of the people to whom I belong
At the end of the day you can tell me I'm wrong
'Cause you went to all of this trouble

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war

We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all
(Let's go!)

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
It feels like war (it feels like war)
Love feels like war (love feels like war)

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Love feels like war, war
Feels like war, war

We go together or we don't go down at all

Don't go down at all!

Is this the end of us or just the means to start again?

My new purple shoes been amazing the people next door
And my rock-and-roll 45s, been enraging the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual

Ooh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy

Ooh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car, I'll make the speed of light out of this place

I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

I'm broken, alone, and afraid

I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners

That's why I am stood here today

Lorsque au soleil couchant les rivieres sont roses,
Et qu'un tiede frisson court sur les champs de ble,
Un conseil d'etre heureux semble sortir des choses
Et monter vers le coeur trouble.

Cependant qu'on est jeune et que le soir est beau
Car nous nous en allons,
Comme s'en va cette onde:
Elle a la mer,
Nous au tombeau

Could start for the corner
Turn up in Spain

I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes
There they go on the floor
I go away weekends
And leave my keys in the door
But why try to change me now

Why can't I be more conventional
People talk
People stare
So I try
But that's not for me
Cuz I can't see
My kind of crazy world
Go passing me by
So let people wonder
Let 'em laugh
Let 'em frown
You know I'll love you
Till the moon's upside down

Love comes from the most unexpected places
In someone's eyes you've never met
Who wants to get to know you
In someone's smile you can't forget
And if the music plays on in your mind
Take all the love that you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love that you can find
And hope it comes again
Love comes from the most unexpected places
A love song on the radio you never heard enough of
In bars that thrive on loneliness
Where people sell their sorrow for your time
They take the love that they can find
And if love takes them in
They take the love that they can find
And hope it comes again

Love comes in many ways
In lovers' arms in sweet bouquets
But if nothing's said than nothing's ever heard
So here I stand outside your door
And I'm trying to tell you just once more
That I love you
I still love you

Love comes from the most unexpected places
Alone again I search a street of unrelated faces
Where strangers look the other way
They're so afraid my smile might say come in
And take the love that you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love that you can find
And hope love comes again

That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

Yeah, I can taste it, it's the end
This love's impossible to save
Though you embrace it, I can't face it
So I look the other way
There's trouble in your eyes
But I pretend that we're okay
I wish that we could compromise

Everything must change
nothing stays the same
everyone must change
no one stays the same
the young become the old
and mysteries do unfold
cause that's the way of time
nothing and no one goes unchanged
there are not many things in life
you can be sure of
except rain comes from the clouds
sun lights up the sky
and hummingbirds do fly
winter turns to spring
a wounded heart will heal
but never much too soon
yes
everything must change
the young become the old
and mysteries do unfold
cause that's the way of time
nothing and no one goes unchanged
there are not many things in life

These are my hands, but what can they give me?
These are my eyes, but they cannot see
These are my arms, but they don't know tenderness
And I must confess that I am usually drawn to sadness
And loneliness has never been a stranger to me

But love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
Guilty of lust and sin
Love tried to take me in

These are my lips, but they whisper sorrow
This is my voice, but it's telling lies
I know how to laugh, but I don't know happiness
And I must confess
Instead of spring it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

Love tried to welcome me
But my soul drew back
I was covered with dust and sin
Love tried to take me in
Love tried to break me

And I must confess, instead of spring, it's always winter
And my heart has always been a lonely hunter, but still

no choice after her father dies but to disguise
herself as a man, so that she can pursue all
her sweet-imagined possibilities. Her journey begins...]

[Prayer:]
Oh God-our heavenly Father
Oh, God-and my father
Who is also in heaven
May the light of this
Flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa can you find me in the night?
Papa are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies I seem to see
A million eyes which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Papa, how I love you
Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me good night

But you're bringing it out of me
And I'm not the type to ever cuff my chick
But I'll make sure you don't leave

When I look at you, it gets so hard to just breath
And the way you move makes me wanna attack you
Especially when you on me
Got the club surrounded by all this movement moves like the waves on the sea,
Like the waves on a sea
Don't ever want you to leave

Leave your ba-be-be-be

Unpack my bags, and take a drag

Open up the door
And lay upon the floor
She open her overcoat
Living out her dreams
Rippin' off my jeans

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

Engine roll, and time to go
At razorback, a hog attack
I'm building steam, for whipping cream
She likes a fat smoking stack

Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
Honey, shoot your load

You are a Ballbreaker

Wrecking ball, let it roll
You are a Ballbreaker
Building steam, for whipping cream

Yeah, man
True story
Real G's with me on this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Wifey home, wedding band, I'm a lucky man
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night, I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie (oh)
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life
Man, I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates
With weather in Atlanta, all outgoing flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way
We started talking business, she handed me a card
We exchanged information, I rented me a car
While I'm driving, she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts
Fine as hell, but I don't wanna break my baby's heart, no, no

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

They call me U-S, H-E-R, R-A, Y-M, O-N-D
And I just wanna do right by my lady
But lately, I been slipping up
Fantasies 'bout dimes on the side, dark tint on my ride
I got a 10 in my ride, I can hide, I can't lie, lie
But ever since I put that band on my hand
More and more chicks trying to get at me than I know what to do
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I
Got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose
Break her heart, I do want to do
I don't want to be that fool, make that move
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules
Bend a bit but never break the rules

Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

She got the door locked and the lock don't fit your key
Yeah, you punching up her numbers in the ADT
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me
Better not feed, feed, feed that appetite
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB
And some other brother been tossing up your PYT
Get caught slipping you gon' wish you would've listened to me
Brother, don't feed, feed, feed that appetite

A hundred miles an hour, you can barely see me movin'
Gotta shorty waitin' for me that I been pursuin'
And I ain't got far to go

She a bad chick, somethin' I ain't tryna ruin
She's steady callin', so I know she ready to get to it
I'm tryna get there but I just can't
Seem to catch up to her

By the time I got there she was gone
And so I walked upstairs and I heard this sound
So pretty, so gritty, so funny that no one's around
So I locked myself inside and closed the door
But there was this funny feeling inside
That I couldn't get rid of, then I sing it

Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall

Standin' in front of my window pane
The sound got me starin' at the rain
The more she play the more I feel the pain
Why is she doing this, what's it to gain?

Seems like she tryna take my soul away
Startin' to feel I'm under her control today
I can't see her but I hear her from the shades
And it seems like she really knows me

Every fiddle makes me wanna run away
I can't take it no more, gotta get away
Got me talkin' about the dark nights
In the cage while she starin' at me

Miss Melody, who could she be? Describin' me
All alone with my ears pressed against the wall
Miss melody, who could she be? Describin' me
Alone with my ears pressed against the wall

Well as a girl you want my money
Yeah but you just won't treat me right
You like to ball every morning
Don't come home till late at night

Oh gonna tell, tell my mama
Lord, I swear girl what you been to me
I'm gonna tell everybody that I'm down in misery

So bye, bye, bye, baby

Goodbye little darlin' down the road I'll go

Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says Aloha to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids say goodnight to the sun

Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep.

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so...
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away... just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Our love was made to rule the world

See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon

[Eminem:]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, Why, God?
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Nicki Minaj:]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Eminem:]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit, pause, inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous, I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you saying?

Fuck! It's fucking raining, shit! There's lightning, bitch!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, shit!
Shit! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump

That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes, all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling you Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing, fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date, you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late, man, and Will I ain't, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees gets a black eye

Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

Puffin' loosies, watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa, you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight

Jets and movers, cesspoolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text Rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 'jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

Must be outta your mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up
This game is over

Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand) Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

I got Jim Beam in the liver, getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk, my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling Go Shady! Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice

Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend

Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him

In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, When you wanna get sexual?
She said, However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible.
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock

One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and [*crash*]
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid…

You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
There's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, I hate blondes, and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit

Shadiest motherfucker you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to Brain Damage, what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!

If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', Fuck safe sex!
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic

And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pen's iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause your innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya to not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna get the shotgun
Or Glock, I'ma opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel

But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser-Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track

Why am I such a dick?
"
684,Alec Benjamin,,Settle Down,,"
_x000D_
He set out with a backpack
A compass in hand
To steal Mona Lisa
And that was his plan
A modern day outlaw
He'll take what he can
And vanish before you
Like tracks in the sand

His pockets were full but his heart was so heavy
And all these material things can be deadly if
No one is there who will share when your seventy-one

If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down

He met her on Tuesday
On his way back from France
He rolled up the painting
He stole with his hands
And even da Vinci
Couldn't have sketched
A more perfect woman
Than the one that he met

His pockets were full but his heart was so heavy
And all these material things can be deadly if
No one is there who will share when your seventy-one

If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down

Settle down, settle down, settle down, settle down

He woke up in the morning
With nothing around
She left with the portrait
No trace of her found
She was the outlaw
She was the one
She took the bounty
And left him with none

His pockets aren't full and his heart is still empty
And falling in love it can be just as deadly
And no one is there who will care when he's seventy-one

If only someone
Filled the spaces
He might settle down

Settle down

Get some love and passion

Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps
Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
Till you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what time it was
My life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now

Had so grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm yours alone

I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize
I whanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now

I know where now

Well I remember when I was as children
The time the people used to treat the neighbor like a fellow man
And all their singin' and big prayer meetin's
When a man was proud to walk up and shake his neighbors hand

Oh you talk about the good times,
Talk about the good times
Oh if you ever needed help a friend was there
Some good neighbor
Help lift your burden
Mmm, and the simple joys of life a friend would share

Times are harder and the people are changin'
Now most folks couldn't tell you who their neighbors are
All their guns are loaded, the front doors are bolted
Ain't this ol' world takin' hate and fear just a little too far

Oh you talk about the good times,
Talk about the good times
I wish I could go back to the days I'm speakin of
When a friend would meet you
And a smile would greet you
What this ol' world needs now is a little old fashioned love

My granddaddy God rest his soul now
Well we had a big long talk together the day he died
Said son this world is full of hate and venom
An' I can't wait to leave this ol' place and rest on the other side

Oh you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Talk about the good times
I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days
We'll have a big hand shakin'
An' sit and talk together
Sit down by the river Jordan and sing our blues away

Oh you talk about the good times, talk about the good times
Talk about the good times
I'm gonna see all the friends I knew in the good ol' days

Oh you talk about the good times, talk about the good times

3095,Bob Dylan,,Up On Cripple Creek,,"
_x000D_
When I get off of this mountain
You know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi river
To the Gulf of Mexico

To Lake Charles, Louisiana
Little Bessie, a girl that I once knew
And she told me just to come on by
If there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show

Odds were in my favor
I had him five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough he had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and blew it in my face
Just for a laugh

Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk

Now that just gave my heart a fall
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now, it's hot in California
And up north it's freezing cold
And this living off the road
Is getting pretty old

So I guess I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
Bet you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted
To go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I...
Hmm...
Could not sleep, would not sleep
'Til love came and told me I should not sleep
Bothered and bewildered am I...
Lost my heart, so what of it?
He was cold, I agree,
He can laugh and I love it
Although the laugh's on me.
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him,
Bewitched, bothered so bewildered am I...

My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young, but you're gonna die

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you

Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringing
Hell's bells
My temperature's high

(One, two)

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time so
Look the other way
You will wait until it's over
To reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little much too late

Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own

I have played in every toilet
But you still want to spoil it
To prove I've made a big mistake
Too long trying to resist it
You've just gone and missed it
It's escaped your world

Can you see that I am needing
Begging for so much more
Than you could ever give
And I don't want you to adore me
Don't want you to ignore me
When it pleases you
And I'll do it on my own
I'll do it on my own

Down these streets the fools rule
There's no freedom or self respect
A knife's point or a trip to the joint
Is about all you can expect

They kill people here who stand up for their rights
The system's just too damned corrupt
It's always the same, the name of the game
Is who do you know higher up

The blacks and the whites
Steal the other kids' lives
Wealth is a filthy rag
So erotic so unpatriotic
So wrapped up in the American flag

The witchcraft scum exploiting the dumb
Turns children into crooks and slaves
Whose heroes and healers are real stoned dealers
Who should be put in their graves

This might be your last night in a bed so soft
There are pimps on the make, politicians on the take
You can't pay us off

We're gonna blow up your home of Voodoo
And watch it burn without any regret
We got the power, we're the new government
You just don't know it yet

For all of my brothers from Vietnam
And my uncles from World War II
I've got to say that it's countdown time now
We're gonna do what the law should do

And for you pretty baby
I know your story is too painful to share
One day though you'll be talking in your sleep
And when you do, I wanna be there

If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love

Every night, every night, I'm on a mood
With a super model, you might seen her from youtube
She's got that good love waiting I got it too
Making either one us waking up next to you, right next to you
See I may be rich, and I may have money
There's something missing in my life I always wanted
Had a 1000 chicks, only few I called my honeys
I need to fall in love and I can see it coming

[Chorus:]
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love

True gentleman, super star,
You see me rolling in, aha, my fancy car
Sitting ride beside me is a beautiful girl I saw
Take her to the boom boom boom and another one to mark
I got an addiction, that's hard to cure
You got an affliction that keeps me wanting more
Changing my direction so I can fall in love
So hard cause my collection is so out of this world
See I may be rich, and I may have money
There's something missing in my life I always wanted
Had a 1000 chicks, only few I called my honeys
I need to fall in love and I can see it coming

[Chorus:]
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love

I know that you would want to
Have someone in your lifetime to love you
If you can show that you really want to
There'll be no limit to what your heart will allow you
When it comes to love, when it comes to love, when it comes to love
I feel empty, still searching
When it comes to love, when it comes to love, when it comes to love
I feel empty, still searching

[Chorus:]
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
Searching for love, I'm just searching for love
I got everything in this world a man could ever want
If you search deeper inside me all I really need is love from you

I don't need diamonds, I don't need jewels
No amount of riches will cover up these blues
I don't need suggestions, on how to start anew
In the lonely hour, I need you

There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless without you

It's a lonesome point of view
When there's a wishful silence, in an empty room
These other voices, they don't cut through
In the lonely hour, I need you

I need you
And I need you

I need someone, that I'll look to,
In the lonely hour, I need you

Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together
Like we don't know how

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We've been together, oh, we've been together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is Nothing is forever
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Hey ya!
Don't want to meet your daddy (oh ohh)
Just want you in my caddy (oh ohh)
Hey ya! (oh, oh!) Hey ya! (oh, oh!)
Don't want to meet your momma
Just want to make you cum-a (oh, oh!)
I'm (oh, oh) I'm (oh, oh) I'm just being honest! (oh, oh)
I'm just being honest!

Ah! Here we go now
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture! Hey ya!

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid

Hey ya! (oh, oh) Hey ya! (oh, oh)

You know what I mean
It's like walking in the heat all day with no water
It's like waiting for a friend
Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
Or losing in an argument
Though you're right, can't get your thoughts in order

Still I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain

But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oooooo oh I've
I've told you now

You know what I mean
Although I try my best, I still let down the team
You're everything I want,
Why should I resist when you are there for me?

Should I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well

But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?

I believe for every drop of rain that falls
a flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
a candle glows
I believe for every one who goes astray
someone will come
to show the way
I believe
I believe
I believe above the storm a smallest prayer
will still be heard
and I believe that someone in the great somewhere
his everyword
everytime I hear a newborn baby cry
or touch a leaf
or see a star
then I know why
I believe
When you walk
through a storm
hold your head up high
and don't be afraid
of the dark
at the end of the storm
is a golden sky
and the sweet silver song of a lark
walk on through the wind
walk on through the rain
though your dreams be tossed
and blown
walk on
walk on
with hope in your heart
and you'll never walk alone
you'll never walk alone
you'll never walk alone

What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us?

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us.
It's all decided for us.
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

Who dares to love forever
When love must die?

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,

And we can have forever,
And we can love forever.

5114,Eminem,,Kick Off (Freestyle),,"
_x000D_
I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fuckin' obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits.
I need you to spit that lyrical miracle… in the swimming pool

Before this kicks off, let me set my balls on this tees
'Cause I'm dottin' I's every time I cross one of these
There's not a redeeming quality at all in me
It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream
Positive clean thoughts intervene
But they're all either altered and mean
Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme
Squashed in between a brainwashing machine
Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical
Suicide bomber that's seeing
Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening
And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving
Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region
I'm not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons
But bring your dogs, I'ma muzzle 'em
I'm not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch rock a hijab
And at least a extra large in a T-shirt
Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista
I go Hamas on the beats, a paradox on the beach
And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list
Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich
Professional shit sprayer
Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear
Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce
Prey's decreasing, I face extinction like disc players
Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett
And just stared 'til I made her think it
Said, Maybe we should just get married.
She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square
Tell her, Turn around, spread her legs for me, then I hit bare
Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair
As I rip, tear, anal beads in a split rear
Spray Febreze in the chick's hair
Make her wheeze tryna get air
I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared
And chained to me, and throw away the key
And she'll be so afraid to leave
That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there
Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up
It's impossible like rapin' a slut
We stay butt-naked and fuck
You're close, wait for you, what?
My idea, you comin' too, is waking you up
With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup
That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup
Hate to get bogged down in details
But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females
My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler
I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular
Shaped but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut
And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck
Or helps you rake in the ducats, I want payment in pub
'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club
But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut

Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it
Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit
Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it
Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no I's in it
Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it
Tryna commit suicide and it took five minutes
And I survived this shit
Someone's gonna challenge me, who?
Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too
You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality
You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale
Only time I start a movement's a bowel
I can't even give a yeah or a woo when you rap in the booth
Not even a nah or a boo
'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew
When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too
'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do
But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you

Creature from the Black Lagoon
I reach up and I smack the moon
You're grief struck that I'm back so soon
Your teacher for this afternoon
Creep up with a pack of hoodlums
We pack a punch like Caprisun
Heat tucked like we each snuck in a sub-machine gun
We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms
Cup of lean up in the padded room
Justin Bieber in a Catholic school
Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him
Don't adjust your speaker
I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo
Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes
Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon
While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop
'Cause her double G-cups are massive, huge!
It's fun for me just to grab a boob
Plus my penis got an attitude
My fuckin' wiener's in a combative mood
Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you
I speak tongue-in-cheek, what you asslicks do
'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true

I just sprung a leak suddenly
What I think in my gut instinct become in sync
My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other
Ink touches the pad, then boom!
Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite
That's basically what makes me me
Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink
Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink
ADD, and better put out an APB
'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street
For you to see Shady beat
And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats
'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat
I pray please Jesus to make me decent
Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline
I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing
I stay free of divas and ladies screamin'
'Cause they keep schemin' on me
Vading keepin' the women at bay
Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses
Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen
It's straight demon—and wait!
Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers
Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant
Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat
Emcees take seats like AMC theaters
Deranged ringleader, depraved king
Who mainstream media hates
Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny
Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room
With the nude Reese Witherspoon
Who was bruised, beat with a broom
It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it
Pit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it
Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it
R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it
It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waist-deep feces
The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases
'Cause my brain releases 'em

Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously
As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues
'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves
Just to fill 'em's a huge feat
A hill and it's too steep
Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots
Keep feedin' me blank sheets
As soon as I sank these teeth
And I'm killin' the loose leaf
Time to shake these trees again
Wait, make that phrase repeat again
Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again
Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em

Vicodins, Nuprins, I bite them and chew them
The whites and the blues mixed with nitrous balloons
And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks
On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance
Who I influence I give two shits
If they wanna license my music to entice with
Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment

Excuse me while I stare into space for a few
In a daze or a haze, glazed over, crazed warped loon
Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view
But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel
No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude
Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled through it
And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy
It's just where the wordplay's goin'
But ain't much I can say or do
'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored}
You say I'm always screw-faced
So if I look your way, you're screwed
'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate war too
'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you

Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants
To the Nike, Jordan hats
The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees
Lightning storms might be formed fast
Such a frightening forecast
But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp
From the cyphering or gasp, but still reciting your raps
While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past
'Cause your heiny's sore, that's
'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass
From the night before last
No good, but rap's somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at
Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat
Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact
They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac?
So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sewed 'em back

Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap
For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back
So difficult to wrap in the prophylactic, it overlaps it
So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat
Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class
The bear you don't wanna poke is back
The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks
When I appear, my peers stop
Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop
Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock
Fear at the mere thought
Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top
I'm in the sky when I talk
Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop

Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you
I got a idea for a line

It's too late to run away from it all

And my heart (and my heart)
It starts pumping (pumping)
Whenever you're around
My whole world's upside down baby

But I try to get closer
And you always push me away
You tell me it's much too soon
But I just can't help it
I always gotta make a play

Oh, baby, boys will be boys

All my senses go right into overdrive
Oh, my defenses are never gonna hold
I always got to lose control

And I hear you say
That you think that we should wait
And I can't hold on anymore
My body's calling for you
So please don't hesitate

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

5313,Justin Timberlake,2013,Only When I Walk Away,The 20/20 Experience: 2 Of 2,"

[Verse 1]
You girl this little game you play
It don’t stop till you go too far
So what’s a man like me to say
With a bullet laying in my heart, damn, love
We go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
Is this shit insane or insane love?
I guess that’s the way we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

[Verse 2]
Now what's that, baby? What you say?
'Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burn it down 'til it ain’t no more

Damn, love, how did the sound get so amped up?.
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit insane or insane love?
Guess that's the way that we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Cold, so cold, cold, so cold

You should see the look on your face
Baby when I finish what you start
But I can’t hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands, love?
Laid you to rest, you said, damn love
This shit's insane, it's insane love
Ain’t that the way we play

[Chorus]
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Cold, so cold

Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away
Ooh so cold
Only when I walk away

Cold, so cold, cold, so cold

But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away
But only when I walk away

She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
What am I gonna do with all this?..
Only when I walk away

(hold up, hold up)

Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, Baby, please stay.
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, Baby, please stay.
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone and tell me, Baby do you stay?
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, Baby, please stay.
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, Baby, please stay.
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, Baby, please stay.

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, Baby, please stay.
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, Baby, please stay.

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, Baby, please stay.
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, Baby, please stay.

I'm scared
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
Oooh
What if
There's another one he's thinking of
Maybe he's in love
I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do
I've been there
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him (Oooh)
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it)
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see

Oooh
I love him (Then show him)
Of that much I can be sure (Hold him close to you)
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Your faith will lead love where it has to go

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Oooh
Never let him go

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
And I wonder should I laugh or cry

He's (he's) dressed (dressed) in the striped pajamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives (gives) me (me) of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder should I laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standin' there on his toes to grow in size
(All I see is)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry

Strange (strange) how (how) dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No (no) more (more) pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on, I feel my throat go dry
And I wonder should I laugh or cry

High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standin' there on his toes to grow in size
(All I see is)
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old-time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

Radio

So, don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Then you have saved someone else

But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else

If you can change someone else

Hey, you, there on the fence
You've got a choice
One day it will make sense

Try to love someone else

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so

When I call her on the telephone
She says, Baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says, Baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know

Who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?

Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em

I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked

I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin', no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin'
For no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, Woo!
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past, motherfucker, he's the shit right now, he's

To wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same old can't afford to be
A lame-o in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the old, H-I to the new, que será
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce, raise 'em high
In the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive

All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn

There must be something in the Kool-Aid
Cruising through the doom days
God knows what is real and what is fake
Last couple years have been a mad trip
How'd you look so perfect?
You must have some portraits in the attic
We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt
Hiding from the real world
Just don't read the comments ever, ever
We fucked this house up like the planet
We were running riot
Crazy that some people still deny it

Think I'm addicted to my phone
My scrolling horror show
I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome
One tab along, it's pornographic
Everybody's at it
No surprise we're so easily bored

Let's pick the truth that we believe in
Like a bad religion
Tell me all your original sins

So many questionable choices
We love the sound that our voice makes
Man, this echo chamber's getting loud

We're gonna choose the blue pill
We're gonna close the curtains
We're gonna rabbit-hole down third-act love now
She's gonna flip some tables
I'm gonna move this tale on
We're gonna rabbit-hole down third-act love now

We'll be the proud remainers
Here till the morning breaks us
We run away from real life thoughts tonight
We're gonna Peter Pan out
Fade to the close-up, arms 'round
We're gonna stay naive tonight-night-night

When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
You, all I think about is you
So I put my phone down
Fall into the night with you

I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
I can't take it anymore
I've been hurt before
Never ever quite like this time

What will become of me when you're no longer here?
If I can't stop loving you
What am I to do?
You'll be free but where will I be?

Now that I'm used to love, how can I stand alone?
Now that love has come and gone
Like the ending of a song
A song my lonely heart keeps singing

Where do I go from here? Will I get over you?
If so, next time I'll be smart
I'll know before I start
A heart that don't care, don't get broken

I hope I never ever love anyone this much again
Never ever, never again, never again

America, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect the women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the United States Government has sworn to uphold
(Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song) or so we're told

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me

So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days

Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide reaching for a T-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?

I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life
And now I'm dumping it on

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby—ooh, baby!—look at my sales

Let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half, I
Ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at

When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
Fuck it! until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up under his ass

Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now
It's

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence

Straight out the tube right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them

That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke
Tightening around my throat
Watching me while I write this
Like I don't like this
Nope

All I hear is lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem
In Harlem
Only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom

So now I'm catchin' the flak
From these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper
To smack a bitch, or say faggot

Shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild
The motherfuckin' spokesman now for

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the Derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the flag and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor
In the faces of in this democracy of hypocrisy

Fuck you, Ms. Cheney
Fuck you, Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you

I'm just playin', America, you know, I love you

We can try again

Is anybody out there?

Don't need anybody but my ba-by

So where did all your love go
You play me like a solo
Then you threw my broken heart away, yeah

I know that we can make it
And I know that you can feel me
So stop fooling around and just stay

Is anybody out there?
Can anybody see?
Seems like everything's gone crazy
You're exactly what I wanted
Exactly what I need
I don't need anybody but my ba-by

It's taken such a long time
To find what I've been looking for
And now that you are all mine
I never felt quite like this before
Still want more
All you need in my mind
Because if so, then you already know
You're all that I want and you're all that I needed

Is anybody out there?
Can anybody see?
Seems like everything's gone crazy
You're exactly what I wanted
And exactly what I need
Don't need anybody but my baby

Detourner des rivieres, porter des poids
Traverser des mers, je saurais faire

Divert rivers, carrying weights

Cross oceans, I would know how
Defier des machines, narguer des lois
Les foudres divines, ca m'effraie pas

Challenging machines, flouting laws

God's wrath, don't afraid me
J'sais prendre un coup, le rendre aussi
River des clous, ca j'ai appris

I know how to accept a hit, give it back also

To punch nails, that I learned
J'suis pas victime, j'suis pas colombe
Et pour qu'on m'abime, faut qu'je tombe

I'm no victim, I'm no dove

And to break me, I have to fall
Je sais les hivers, je sais le froid
Mais la vie sans toi, je sais pas

I know the winters, I know the cold

But life without you, I don't know
Je savais le silence depuis longtemps
J'en sais la violence, son gout de sang

I knew the silence for a long time

I know it's violence, it's blood taste
Rouges coleres, sombres douleurs
Je sais ces guerres, j'en ai pas peur

Red angers, dark pains

I know the wars, I'm not afraid of them
Je sais me defendre, j'ai bien appris
On est pas des tendres par ici

I can defend myself, I learned well

We're not tenders by here

But life without you, I don't know
Lutte apres lutte, pire apres pire
Chaque minute, j'ai cru tenir

Fight after fight, worst after worst

Each minute, I tought I could hold
J'voudrais apprendre jour apres jour
Mais qui commande a nos amours?

I would love to learn day after day

But who orders to our loves?
Je sais les hivers, je sais le froid

5569,Madonna,1996,Don't Cry For Me Argentina,soundtrack: Evita,"

[Eva:]
It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true

7104,Paul McCartney,2005,Riding To Vanity Fair,Chaos And Creation In The Backyard,"
_x000D_
I bit my tongue
I never talked too much
I tried to be so strong
I did my best
I used the gentle touch
I've done it for so long

You put me down
But I can laugh it off
And act like nothing's wrong

But why pretend
I think I've heard enough
Of your familiar song

I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll try to take my mind off you
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

You're not aware
Of what you put me through
But now the feeling's gone
But I don't mind
Do what you have to do
You don't fool anyone

I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I'll take a different point of view
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

The definition of friendship
Apparently ought to be
Showing support for the
One that you love
And I was open to friendship
But you didn't seem to have any to spare
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

There was a time
When every day was young
The sun would always shine
We sang along
When all the songs were sung
Believing every line

That's the trouble with friendship
For someone to feel it
It has to be real
Or it wouldn't be right
And I keep hoping for friendship
But I wouldn't dare
To presume it was there
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

While you were riding to Vanity Fair
While you were riding to Vanity Fair
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

They used to run, used to run, used to run right here
And all I see is an empty road
Wild, wild, wild roses tell me
Where did they all go?
When I was young, I was young, they would spread like fire
And now their roots don't know where to grow

Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it's out of control
I don't think that this
Is the world we used to know
Is the world we used to know

Wide, wide, wide oceans tell me
Where do you lead?
When the sun and the sky come to meet at night
I wonder, would you carry me?
Why won't you tell me if I'm on my own
You used to be, used to be, used to be right here
And now I don't know where to go

Did it come overnight or did it come on slow?
It's out of our hands and it's out of control

She didn't pay admission, snuck in at intermission
She showed up with a vision on a motherfucking mission
Already hot and sweaty like she'd been up in the kitchen
Looking for some action, tryna build a coalition
Dancing with a passion, you know the position
Grinding on my troops, tryna rile up my militia
I can't turn her off after I switched on her ignition
She wants to add a friend, and I'm a gifted mathematician

Passion-driven, passion addict
Passion basement, passion attic
Passion domestic, passion abroad
Passion always, passion God

I have a passion for passions
I come in hot I turn dragons to ashes
Ignite the whole matchbook of matches
I strike, and I don't close the cover or batten the hatches
I look the world in her eyeballs
I tell her my theories, my breakthroughs and the newest of my thoughts
I don't wait for the ovation to conclude
I find applause
Sound's perfect in the background when I talk, it's like

A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your ear
A sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear

[Intro: Justin Timberlake (Timbaland)]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
(And all in thrilling, new, living sound)
Dammit babe

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the falling type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called Control was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit
Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claiming they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep calling on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie, fuck you know about blowin' bands
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day 1, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's all dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the 3 piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO

Happiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew

Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our lips
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our hips

Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do

Happiest girl I ever knew

Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our eyes
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our thighs

And I would have to pinch her
Just to see if she was real
Just to watch the smile fade away
And see the pain she'd feel

Wanted to feel her joy
Feel it deep within

Oh, it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing I'm waiting for
Well then I'll se you tonight in my dreams

Seems a long time since we've been together
It was just about to this time of the year
Looks like it's gonna be snowy weather
How I wish that you could be here

But it won't seem like christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams

In the distance I hear sleigh bells ringing
The holly is so pretty this year
And the carol that somebody's singing
Reminds me of our christmas last year

Everybody wants in different directions
The whole world's running to each his own
It's a place that justifies it all
And nobody's ever wrong
I guess we got to agree to disagree
Even if we're singing the same song
You can't try to change a life that don't want to be changed
If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey 

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
And we'll be alright
Alright

Everybody longs for success, whatever that is
The whole world's longing for each his own
It's a place where the truth stays in the light
Cause nobody ever lies
And we follow our hearts into the night
Wake up thankful to be alive
You can't try to save a life that don't want to be saved
If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
We'll be alright
Alright

I am who I am
And you are who you are
I could wish on a cloud
And you could wish on a star
Still we'll be alright

So let's keep running to each his own
If we all keep running then we can toast
To each his own
And we'll be alright
We'll be alright

Give you something real wet, to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you

Do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Birkin where the bag is
Got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status

All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare
Without love I've had nothing at all

Without love I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all

Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Without love I've had nothing at all

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveller
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveller
This is now my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can't resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won't erase me
But I can't help to see how this dark city changed me
It's all the same scene, music is my life
But now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London's my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay away from all the negative shit that will follow me

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away? (Ay-ay-ay-ay)

Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away

Plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewhere eastern, they'll have what I need (They'll have what I need)

Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away, floating away

Take me to some kinda

Please stay where you are

Don't try to change my mind

You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine

Please don't fall apart

Stop asking me to stay

That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart

I've got a riddle, what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
That'll do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walking the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian
No it's Dave, Raymond and oh, Osorio
So sorry whoa, but that was a long time ago
When I was just Joe Shmo, rapping in Joe Blow's basement
I apologized fo' it before, so
Either accept it or you don't
And let's move on, if I ain't shown that I've grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
The question I ask is
How can I explain this?
How can I swing this, in English language?
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
Do I do it in vain, or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water
Woady on my daughter I told you I love this culture
Don't let em insult ya, I'ma tell you one more 'gain
This is the environment that I was brought up 'in
But every now and 'then, I use my 'pen
To get rid of some frustration, or should I say shon
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism?
Your face is numb, you're stunned you look as cold
Like that of a man who's 70 some years old
And it only gets colder, which is why I understand
I can't be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder
Who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
Is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin, is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the [?] down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buying two white guys
Disguised as pro-black there's no slack for a Hartford college grad
In a fitted hat and a hunch back, standing by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks, yeah

[Chorus:]
Call on Dolly!
If your neighbour needs a new romance
Just name that kind of man your sister wants
And she'll snatch them up
Don't forget to bring your maiden aunts and
She'll match 'em up.

[Dolly:]
I have always been a woman who arranges things,
for the pleasure--and the profit--it derives.
I have always been a woman who arranges things,
like furniture and daffodils and lives.

If you want your sister courted, brother wed, or cheese imported:
Just leave everything to me.
If you want your roof inspected, eyebrows tweezed, or bills collected:
Just leave everything to me.
If you want your daughter dated, or some marriage consummated,
for a rather modest fee.
If you want a husband spotted, boyfriend traced, or chicken potted:
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
Just leave everything to me.

If you want your ego bolstered, muscles toned, or chair upholstered:
Just leave everything to me.
Charming social introductions, expert mandolin instructions:
Just leave everything to me.
If you want your culture rounded, French improved, or torso pounded:
With a ten year guarantee.
If you want a birth recorded, collies bred, or kittens ported:
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything to me.

([Mr. Sullivan:] Where to, Dolly?
[Dolly:] Yonkers, New York, to handle a highly personal matter for
Mr. Horace Vandergelder, the well-known, unmarried, half-a-millionaire.
[Mr. Sullivan:] Gonna marry him yourself, Dolly?
[Dolly:] Why, Mr. Sullivan, whatever put such a preposterous idea into my head--your head!)

If you want a law abolished, jury swayed, or toenails polished:
Just leave everything to me.
If you want your liver tested, glasses made, cash invested:
Just leave everything to me.
If you want your children coddled, corsets pulled, or furs remodeled,
or some nice, fresh fricassee.
If you want your bustle shifted, wedding planned, or bosom lifted--
Don't be ashamed girls,
Life is full of secrets, and I keep 'em!

I'll discretely use my own discretion
I'll arrange for making all arrangements
I'll proceed to plan the whole procedure
Just leave everything to me!

But I left school and grew my hair

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll

A rock 'n' roll guitar
I got to be on top someday
I wanna be a star

And I can see the queue
I've got the devil in my blood
Telling me what to do

Well you can stick your nine-to-five livin'
And your collar and your tie
You can stick your moral standards
'Cause it's all a dirty lie
You can stick your golden handshake
And you can stick your silly rules
And all the other shit
That you teach to kids in school
'Cause I ain't no fool

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man

Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter
Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man

But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again

If you're on my list
It's just a question of when
When I get a yen,
Then baby, amen
I'm counting to ten
And then

I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan
This time I'm not only getting, I'm holding my man

If I give my love again to you, mm
Will it be the same love that we once thought was true?
Will it be the same love, mm?
Will we feel the same love?
Will it be the same love that you once made to me?

The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me
The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me

If it's nothing like the first time, we’ll enjoy it right or wrong
Why keep referring to the worst time, when you've waited for so long?
Waited for so long?

Though it may not be as good as you
Well, still, it must be better than the pain that I went through

Will it be the same love?
Will it feel the same, love?
Will it be the same love that you once made to me?

The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me
The love you made to me, the love you made to me
The love you made to me

What good is dreamin'
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust
Like a book on a shelf

Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now

Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't you leave me now

Nights on ice, if we don't score

It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people
Who watched you grow up
When you're a member
Go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

She had never gone that far
Normally, this would be the time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving

No, happily never after

I know, I deserve better after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

Fall, oh, oh, oh

She starts to smile, yeah
Realized she hadn't for a while
No destination, she drove for miles
Wondering why she stayed in such denial

Are said too much
They're not enough
So if I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

So if I lay here
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world

Afraid that I won't make it, but if I never step outside
Of my comfort zone, here in my home
I'll never know where I could go

Wanna find a girl, but can't find my phone
I just lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreamin' 'bout the things that I wanna do
If I wanna change the world, I should change myself
I should make my bed, I should dust the shelf
Shouldn't lie in bed 'til the afternoon
Dreamin' 'bout the things that I wanna do, mhm

'Bout the things that I wanna do

There can be no humiliation without accountability
If I just stay home, here all alone
In my comfort zone, but now I know
It's worth it to make some mistakes
You miss all of the shots that you don't take

Wanna find a girl, but can't find my phone

Of my very own creation

Wanna find a girl, but can't find my phone

We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?

Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare

Tell me

Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember how we used to talk
You know we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said
Like I love you so I'll never let you go

Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And, girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had

Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
Do you remember the time when we fell in love

Do you remember, girl
Remember the time
On the phone you and me
Remember the time
'Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?

Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me in Spain
What about, what about
Remember the time

Remember the time
In the park
Remember the time
After dark, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you

I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind

So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become

Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture-perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well

And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans

Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain

And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner

I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue,
And wish that I had known what to do as a younging
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh

And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, Fuck you

I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for

And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Well, yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressin' 'cause
Every day this shit gets the best of us

Usin' my balance on eraser blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold
Mum sayin', Don't smoke, no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign

Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men

And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit

I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad

And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

There's a balmy little breeze
That's whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up a little closer and be my little honey bee

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make it fun it takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting
Why don't you start co-operating
And the things I say are things you want to hear

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make it fun it takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

There once was a time when I thought if I had a house, I'd be happy
There once was a time when I thought if I had a car, I'd be made

One by one I achieved my ambitions
But didn't feel like I wanted to feel
Didn't feel like I wanted it to feel
I didn't feel like I wanted to feel

I needed a comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I needed a comfort of love
Just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh

I long for the time when the world is a better place, to be happy
I long for the day when the people who went to sleep, will awake

One by one I improved my conditions
But it doesn't feel like I wanted to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted it to feel
Doesn't feel like I wanted to feel

I needed the comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I need the comfort of love
To just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh

I needed a comfort of love
Any place and anytime
I needed a comfort of love
To just to get me some piece of mind

Well, I needed the comfort
I needed the comfort
I needed the comfort of love

I needed the comfort
I needed the comforte

Watch out!

I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Open your heart
I'll make you love me
It's not that hard
If you just turn the key

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

Open your heart with the key
Open your heart
I'll make you love me
It's not that hard
If you just turn the key
Open your heart
I'll make you love me
It's not that hard
If you just turn the key
Open your heart
I'll make you love me
It's not that hard
If you just turn the key

2848,Bob Dylan,1986,Brownsville Girl,Knocked Out Loaded,"
_x000D_
Well there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding across the desert and starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The town's people wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

Well the Marshall now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death

Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

Well we drove that car all night 'til we got into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off

Well we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love. Well we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back. She saw us
Come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said Henry ain't here but you can come on in he'll be back in a little while

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of bumming
A ride back to where she started
But she changed the subject every time money came up
She said Welcome to the land of the living dead. You could tell she was
So broken-hearted
She said Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt

How far are you all going ? Ruby asked us with a sigh
We're going all the way until the wheels fall off and burn
Until the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies
Ruby just smiled and said. Ah you know some babies never learn

Something about that movie though well I just can't get it out of my head
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking my way

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love

Well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing the street when shots rang out
I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran
We got him cornered in the churchyard? I heard somebody shout

Well you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it it said
A man with no alibi
You went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do

Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes
You just find yourself over the line
Oh if there's an original thought out there I could use it right now
You know I feel pretty good but that ain't saying much I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how
Well I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah but you know it's not the one that I had in mind
He's got a new one out now I don't even know what it's about
But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love

You know it's funny how things never turn out the way you had them planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name
Wasn't Henry Porter
And you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too
Good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind
In the French Quarter

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who
Are most content
I don't have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone
You always said people don't do what they believe in they just do what's most
Convenient then they repent
And I always said. Hang on to me baby and let's hope that the roof stays on

There was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun and he was shot
In the back
Seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl show me all around the world
Brownsville girl you're my honey love

Yeah, Bad and Evil is (BACK)
We bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
This is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
Oh once again where I fail from blundering
Shady lifted his wing than I fell from under it
Now I'm freefallin'
My career is gone and the weed callin'
Regardless of who's fault I was b-ballin'
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth
Marshall double backed and got me from on top of the Hearse
I'm alive nigga, Justin T ain't got nothing on me
Cause I done cried Mary J Blige rivers
I realized that God's with us as soon as I decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
The writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z
Suddenly everybody calls
Like I'm just checking on you dog
While I throw up this message on the star

[Chorus:]
When them bottles stop poppin'
And them dollars start stopping
Do what you did to get it and dont stop (dont stop)
I made a promise to my momma
I'mma out live her
How can I be a quitter when haters dont stop (dont stop)

I'm living proof nigga
Its pretty safe to say
God giveth and God taketh away
Its the Worldwide American way
I'm living proof nigga

Your body language is sayin' your confidence is gone
Well pick ya ass up lil homie, come on
You just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
Tell em where to shove it straight up, you gon' make love to the world or you gon' fuck it?
The last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophy it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I aint poop
Shit, the day that I dont straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
Without remorse man
Man of course I'm a one trick pony
Cause I'll be screaming on these whores till I'm hoarse!

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5' 9]
Nah I aint fading yet
I'd rather stay and rap
I mighta made a deck
I find excitement in wondering what I'ma write next
So I dont stay in debt
Me broke
You might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
With AK's with baby bayonet's
I'ma get rich or I'mma die trying
Thats why its either kill or be killed
So call me suicide homocide Ryan

[Eminem]
Theres a bomb inside my head
I'ma live wire, I am on the edge
Teetering on it like I tore the iron mike
Get on a nut like a tyre iron
I have no desire stopping so why would I drop and roll
That's how much on fire I am
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flying by 'em
Man I'm laughing at 'em the entire time, why am I up?
Cause tribulations I have triumphed bitch I'm fired up
So it's time for me to slit your fucking lighter, light the sky up

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand,
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Oh the neons are a gleamin' and the gamblers are a dreamin'
Oh it's night life, yeh! night life
The chips are a spillin' and it's time to make a killin'
Oh it's night life, yeh! night life
Oh the pockets are a-burnin' and the money flies
With dice roll a-turnin' and you'll hit snakes eyes
You can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of 
Night life night life

There're long legged women who will take you for a trimmin' yes it's night life
Oh night life.
Their lips taste like honey but they're out to spend your money
Yes it's night life. Oh yeh!
Just roll that seven and you'll hear them shriek
When seven come eleven it's a lucky streak
You can't beat the drama, the excitement and the glamour
Of the night life, I said that night life

So place your bet, come on make your play
Though you may regret it at the break of day
I said you can't be a quitter when you're caught up in the glitter of 
Night life night life
Yeh! that night life, good ol' night life

6247,Michael Jackson,2011,Is It Scary/Threatened (Immortal Version),soundtrack: Immortal,"

[Haunted Voice:]
I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

[Michael Jackson:]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere

(Aaaahhh!)

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is this scary for you, baby
Is this scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is this scary for you, baby

[*Whispering and breathing*]
{Sorcery... Illusions...}

There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night

But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me

[*Reporter speaking*]

All hail, the king has risen

You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

Watched my love

Heard my truth turn to lies
Seen the tears in my eyes

I come up to meet you
Up there somewhere
When I rush to greet you

Gave more for you
Dropped my crutches
And crawled on the floor for you
Went looking behind every door for you
And because of the things
That I saw for you
I spiritually grew

When I rush

Goodnight and thank you Huevo
She is in every magazine
Been photographed, seen, she is known
We don't like to rush, but your case has been packed
If she's missed anything, you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone 

[Eva:]
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both stop fooling ourselves

[Che:]
Which means ...

[Che and Eva:]
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn't an eye on, in fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same

[Che:]
Goodnight and thank you Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all, if she needs you she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow

[Eva:]
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot, we were hot
I know you'll look back on the good times we've shared

There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover, male or female

Support them, promote them
Don't blame her, you're the same

There is no soap, no soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion, or oil with such power in the shower

One little frolic with new Zaz carbolic
You're scented, you'll be sent

Goodnight and thank you Senor Jabon
We are grateful you found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go

Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive

Which means ...

This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules

She needs a man she can monopolize
With fingers in dozens of different pies

There are songs that sound like movies
There are themes that fill the screen
There are lines I say that sound as if they're written
There are looks I wear the theater should have seen
But though I've made my life a movie
The matinee must end by five
And I must stagger out into the blinding sunlight half alive
Wishing I were back inside the picture show
There where it's always night
Notice how the screen is wide
The second role I've said around too tight
Will I stay? Yes, I might
Oh widescreen wider on my eyes
Lie my mind with lies
Find the world like nothing that I've seen
Oh widescreen dreams are just my sighs
As we walk from out the movie
Are we acting out a scene
Does the orchestra play chords
When we start loving?
Do we move just like slow motion
On the screen?
Life's a constant disappointment
When you live on celluloid
But my movie expectations are a dream I can't avoid
Waiting for a man to say the things
That I heard in the film last night
But he doesn't want to play the role
And he can't pick his cues up right
Will I dream? Yes, I might!
Oh widescreen winding round my eyes
Blinding me with lies
Finding I've been fooled by what I've seen
No, widescreen dreams are more than you
How can lies be true?
All we have is life and mind
And love we find with a friend
Oh let the movie end...

We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late, when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it, to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind

But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

Ooh oh oh

And now I need to know is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?

And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

Our love is

There would be such wonderful things to do
If were the only girl in the world

I turn around and then another one come
On God, I be tryin' baby
At least you know the truth, I ain't lyin' baby
Every time I say my new girl is the best
Then I get another text from my ex
On God, it's like clockwork
She come through, I take her down and buy a new purse

And never thought she'd be alone
But that day soon comes
Her boyfriend left her for another
Now she's pregnant with his son
She ain't the only one
Going through rough times
Under the city nights
Even sold her body to keep on the lights
Searching for that love
Her daddy didn't provide
She found a pimp and he's that guy
Smacked her up and told her

She won't make it
Judged her from her past
Told her that she was nothing
She was raised way too fast
Even say she can't take it
Her success won't last
But let me tell you something, yeah

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched and I've searched
But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
One accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search
But you'll never find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll so no man
You can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire

To face unafraid the plans that we made

It made you a god
Priests, popes, and preachers would tell me I did it wrong
But, hey

Now, what do I say
To make me exist? Oh

Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die your slave, I'd tell you right now
But you still don't know my name, yeah

Wish you, wish you'd come over, mmh
Miss you, kiss you in make-believe
I'm dreaming of all of the possibilities
I'm kissing all over your body, my Nefertiti
And every time I think the planets aligning
You're still so close, but yet so far

Still don't know my name
You still don't know my name
And I would die your slave, I'd tell you right now

Chills

New York back in August, tenth floor balcony
Smoke is floating over Jane and Greenwich street
Goosebumps from your wild eyes when they're watchin' me
Shivers dance down my spine and head down to my feet

Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

Giving me chills
Chills

Sunset tower lobby, waiting there for me
In the elevator, fumble for your key
Kissed in every corner, Presidential Suite
Opened up Bordeaux from 1993

Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

Giving me chills

Take my, take-take my breath away, just like
Take my breath away, just like, souvenir
Take my, take-take my breath away, just like
Take my breath away, just like, souvenir

You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

Take my breath away, just like, souvenir

Your name was the one
That was always chosen
Your words and their kindness
Have set me free

Shame has a hold
That's kept us frozen
You opened my eyes to a world
That I could believe

Words can leave you
Broken inside
You'll have to decide
I'm hanging on to my pride

We are here
We can love
We share something
I'm sure that you mean the world to me
When you get what you need
There's no way of knowing
What you'll have
Is another hole to feed

The games that were played
Have left us hoping
The gift that we have - the life
That we breathe

This world can leave you
Broken inside
With nowhere to hide

Why would we divide when we could come together?
Just bodies that collide, lost and found each other
So don't, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Why would we divide when we could come together?

Looking back around, glamorize the chaos
Don't let summer nights destroy everything before us

So don't, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone

Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for some time,
Sweet little lass you are my long haired lady.

Who's the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter?
She's the lady who wears those flashing eyes.
Who'll be taking her home when all the dancing is over?
I'm the lucky man she will hypnotise.

Long haired lady,

Bees are buzzing around my sweet, delectable baby,
Birds are humming about their big surprise.
Who's your favourite person, dear phenomenal lady?
I belong to the girl with the flashing eyes.

And I'm not suicidal, I just drink to forget my problems
Seems like the kids these days are all just lookin' to get higher, oh
I'm just the same, anything's I won't tell momma and father

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothin' wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

I got my woman, got my high, my guitar, and some money
And I'll be goddamned if these fuckers try to take that from me
But ain't shit wrong with us and don't tell me, Talk to somebody
I'm drunk at 2 p.m., treat every day like it's a Friday

Want it all and we want it now

The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Number forty-seven said to number three:
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Sad Sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone.
The warden said, Hey, buddy, don't you be no square.
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, For Heaven's sake,
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break.
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, Nix nix,
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love

I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out

(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love

You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it

You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands

But you can rise up like a God
Arm yourself
You can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire

Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy

Now you finally have the codes
I have given you the code

To love and cherish

It's you and me babe
Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were

There's no countries left
To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It's human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive alone
With no one left to love

There's no culture left
To love and cherish

Lost in space and time for ever more

Lock up my condense and rhyme, don't know what I'm trying to say
(My heart) all the time was stolen, by bad poetry

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open, love's insanity
So long words are left unspoken, couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
(My heart) I'm left with a broken vocabulary

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst 
(And when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed 
(And you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends 
(Together again)
When I meet my friends
(I'm gonna see them now)
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
Ah-haa (ah-haa, ah-haa)
You paint your world and use all colours
Ah-haa (ah-haa)
And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
Ah-haa (ah-haa, ah-haa)
The songs you sing are too romantic
Ah-haa (ah-haa)
And when you want the truth 
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst
(You know you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed
(And you've got it sad)
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll...

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself

Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotized, I feel paralized
I have found heaven
There's a thousand reasons
Why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
Keep me hanging on
Feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself

I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of conteptment now that you are here
I feel satisfied
I belong inside
Your velvet heaven

Did I need to sell my soul
For pleasure like this
Did I have to lose control
To treasure your kiss
Did I need to place my heart
In the palm of your hand
Before I could even start
To understand

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else

Tu tues tous mes papillons noirs

Pas très fort

Te faire d'la peine
Sans d'abord me passer sur le corps

Fie-toi sur moi

T'auras jamais peur
Tant que j'vivrai
Même, même si je meurs

Une chance que j't'ai

Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be afraid

It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real

Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Where the hustlas stay and the criminals robbers shooters
On the corner with the keys in hand

We'll lift you off your feet and make you fly like Peter Pan
Don't make no sudden moves
Or I'll squeeze my southern tools
While I'm with my southern bitch
26 inches no southern shoes
I ride out slide out
Groupies cry they eyes out
Cause they making the kind of paper that dope boys get when they bring them pies out
Wasn't born with a silver spoon
So recognise when you hear that tune

And I'm a kryptonite it

Made her drop to her knees
Got a taste of this [?] taller than all of your trees

And rolling hips to the beat

And I don't know how to shake it
Got these itchy feet for a change of scene
Do anything to escape it

Be like anybody else
Broke down, nothing else left

Oh what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago
Oh what I'd do not to worry like you

C'mon, relax

There's an English man up in space these days
Floating in awe and wonder
As he broke away from the atmosphere
From all of us non believers

Run away as fast as you can go

Or just a form of modern art

You played a skeleton
You took my love then died that day

'Cause he owed me money

The one in the summer where we used to smoke pot
I guess I didn't mean it
But man, you shoulda seen it

His flesh explode

What a brother knows
Slow motion see me let go

Now the cops will get me
But girl, if you would let me
I'll take your pants off

Later bathing in the afterglow
Two lines of coke I cut with Draino
And her nose starts to bleed

A most beautiful ruby red
Slow motion see me let go
We'll remember these days
Slow motion see me let go
Urban life decays
Slow motion see me let go
And at home

My sister's eating paint chips again
Maybe that's why she's insane
I shut the door to her moaning
And I shoot smack in my veins
Wouldn't you?
See my neighbor's beating his wife
Because he hates his life
There's an arc to his fist as he swings
Oh man, what a beautiful thing

And death slides close to me
Won't grow old to be
A junkie wino creep

Hollywood glamorized my wrath
I'm a young urban psychopath
I incite murder for your entertainment
'Cause I needed the money
What's your excuse?

On another world by another star
At another place and time
In another state of consciousness
In another state of mind

Everything was almost perfect
Everything fell into place
The jury reached a different verdict
Before the judge dismissed the case

In a parallel universe
That's happening right now
Things between us must be worse
But it's hard to see just how

And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect
Accused, abandoned and disgraced

I didn't shoot, I didn't pull the trigger
It wasn't me I'm just a plain and simple singer
I heard the sound, I turned my head around
To watch our love shot down

In another lonely universe
We're laying side by side
And no one's hurt and no one's cursed
And no one needs to hide

And everything is almost perfect
Everything is almost right
There are never any conflicts
There are never any fights

_x000D_
It's a long lonely highway when you're travellin' all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
But you gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line

It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line

I gotta rock for my pillow 'neath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed

My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway gettin' longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
Well, I'm gonna lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
You gotta keep on goin', on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin', though there's no-one to care
Just keep movin' down the line
Movin' down the line
Movin' down the line

Well, He's so high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)

Oh well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
He's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
So low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well I went down in the valley
You know I did over there ever stay
My soul got happy in the valley
You know I stayed right there all day

Well, He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
And he's wide (so wide you can't get around Him)
I know he's so low (so low you can't get under him)
The mighty lamb (you must come in at the door)

Well I ain't been to heaven but I'm, I'm told
The streets the streets are pearls
You know the mighty mighty
Mighty gates are gold

And He's high (so high you can't get over Him)
So wide (so wide you can't get around Him)

I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now

Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You find me
In the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down,
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now

Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

Mmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Album version stops here]

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha.

I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just want to spend all my time with you (Feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress
Don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party
I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you
All night long

I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happening so easily (Like oh my God)
It's so hard to digest
Usually I'm best alone
But every time that you text
I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you
All night long

Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And then some)
The sight of you is dramatic
One glimpse and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours
'Cause you possess powers I can't fight
That's why I dream about you
All night long

All night long

Check it out
I'm saying
You gonna be mine

First time I saw you, baby, you did something to me
That no else has ever done
It's something in your eyes caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one

But what's bad is I know you got a man
And he'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
Something inside of me
Is saying you and I were meant to be
If you can think it, you can have it
That why I believe

One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around

Now, every time I see you, baby, it's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missing at home, baby
So much love to share, it's something in the air
Telling me I should never leave you alone

But even though I know you got a man
He'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
You can try to stop it, but it won't quit
You say you don't when I know that you want it
I know, one day you'll be mine

One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around

When you fall asleep with your head upon my shoulder.
When you're in my arms but you've gone somewhere deeper.

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?
Are you going to age with grace,
Or only to wake and hide your face?

When oblivion is calling out your name,
You always take it further than I ever can.

When you play it hard, and I try to follow you there.
It's not about control but I turn back when I see where you go.

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

When oblivion is calling out your name,
You always take it further than I ever can.

Oh oblivion is calling out your name,
You always take it further than I ever can.

3102,Bob Dylan,,Yonder Comes Sin,,"
_x000D_
You wanna talk to me,
You got many things to say.
You want the spirit to be speaking through,
But your lust for comfort get in the way.
I can read it in your eyes, oh,
What your heart will not reveal.
And that old evil burden has been draggin' you down,
Bound to grind you 'neath the wheel

Yonder comes sin.
(Walkin' like a man, talkin' like an angel.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Proud like a peacock, swift like an eagle.)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they been into.
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

You see this woman standin' next to me.
She's foreign to your sight.
Well, her eyes may be a different colour than mine,
But her blood is red and her bones are white.
You've been seeking them eternal, spiritual things,
But your fifty-dollar smile confirms
You're still tryin' to buy your way into the dreams of them,
Whose bodies will be food for worms.

Yonder comes sin.
(Ready and steady, willing and able.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Standin' on the chair, standin' on the table.)
Look at your feet, see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Can't you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

I say: See them six wild horses, honey.
You say: I don't even see one..
You say: Point them out to me, love.
I say: Honey I got to run.
My brother's blood is crying from the grave,
But you can't hear the voice.
I stand in jeopardy every hour,
Wonderin' what reason you have to rejoice.

Yonder comes sin.
(Down on your knees, down into the ditches.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Vomiting up jewels, vomiting up riches.)
Look at your feet see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Enough to put you to tail-spin.
Yonder comes sin.

Jeremiah preached repentance
To those that would turn from hell.
But the critics all gave him such bad reviews.
Put him down at the bottom of a well.
Kept on talking anyway,
As the people were put into chains.
Wasn't nobody there to say Bon voyage
Or shatter any bottles of champagne.

Yonder comes sin.
(Cracking that whip, just like a feather.)
Yonder comes sin.
(Put a knife in your back while talking about the weather.)
Look at your feet see where they've been to.
Look at your hands, see what they've been into.
Can you take it on the chin?
Yonder comes sin.

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm sipping champagne 'til we throw it up
I drinked enough for both of us
You talking way, way too fast for me now
So pour up everything to slow it all up
I talked about this finally famous lifestyle way back, baby when we was growing up
Made a few plays now everything that we talked about showing up, and I could chauffeur up
But I still get lost on the map to your heart
So far gone let's take it back to the start
To the part where we carved our name in the bark
Preserved all the feelings like it came in the jar
I guess like ain't no picnic basket
You put four years and came out a bachelor
This time around has does me and you sound
Cause honestly to me it sounds mixed and mastered
Right?

[Bridge: Maroon 5]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

[Pre-Hook: Maroon 5]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Hook: Maroon 5]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 2: Maroon 5]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
Cause something strange has come over me
Now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you

I got a big, fat Cadillac built for you
I got a honk that'll blow the avenue
Got a hard enough kicking, now bend my thing
Got a sugar looking woman with a bald-headed man
Give me Five-0, here boy, that's what I'll do
Got a big fat mama who can hold a tune
Gotta slip that bone in hard and mean
A honky-tonk woman got the best of me

Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back
Can't hold me back, you get a heart attack
Can't hold me back

Got a honky-tonk big bone, hit to thrill
I got a sugar boot 'n' money babies that'll kill
All honky tonk 15 golden mile
Got a blonde-headed woman loaded in the town
You can get me to the ball, man, divin' in
And don't balk the kill, ball in her 'ville
You gotta a map the wrong town, hit the road
You got a whole boppa movin' on down the road

Let's turn off our phones tonight
And rely on the stars
We've been so lost lately
We forgot who we are
But I got everything I need, baby
In the palms of your touch
In a world of dark distractions
It can all get too much

So let's sit by an English river
'Til the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

I know you're feeling weighed down tonight
And you can't find the breaks
Every day is too long for you
You were sworn to your fate
But we got everything we need, baby
In the memories we make
In a world of reinventions
It's never too late

So let's sit by an English river
'Til the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

So let's sit by an English river
'Til the water runs dry
There is nothing that we've done wrong
That can't be made right
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time

I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet

I still love getting out of my mind, I should it cut down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late night calls, signal is in and out again
Feeling low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy trying to chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes

I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
Have no regrets but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep
I'll stay awake 'til I trade my mistakes
Or they fade away

Deserted, my organs can go on without me
You can't fly these wings
You can't sleep in this box with me

Let me save you, hold this rope

I may never sleep tonight
As long as you're still burning bright
If I could trade mistakes for sheep
Count me away before you sleep

Hold this rope and I'll pull you in
'Cause I am an anchor
Save her or feel it sinking in
Let me save you, hold this rope
(This is only the greatest story ever told)
I am an anchor, sinking her

Count me away before you sleep

Tomorrow forOld England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales

And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see that foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell

I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee

And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the Dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly

2639,Bob Dylan,1964,When The Ship Comes In,The Times They Are A-Changin',"
_x000D_
Oh the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
'Fore the hurricane begins
The hour when the ship comes in

And the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

Then they'll raise their hands
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharaoh's tribe
They'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered

There is a fine line
Between recklessness and courage
It's about time
You understood which road to take
It's a fine line
And your decision makes a difference
Get it wrong you'll be making a big mistake

Come home brother all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother everything is better
Everything is better when you come home to stay

Whatever's more important to you
You've gotta choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be
Well that's the view that you got to see

There is a long way
Between chaos and creation
If you don't say
Which one of these you're going to choose
It's a long way
And if every contradiction seems the same
It's a game that your bound to lose

Come home brother all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother everything is better
Everything is better when you come home to stay

Come on back, Come on back, Come on back to me

It's a fine line, It's a fine line

Whatever's more important to you
You've gotta choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be
Well that's the view that you got to see

It's a fine line

Whatever's more important to you 
You've gotta choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be 
Well that's the view that you got to see

I am slowly learning that the things you promised me
Are burning like the embers of a thousand willow trees
And every single secret has been broadcast like TV
Now all the threads are severed that were tying you to me

I thought we were friends, but now we're enemies
I thought we were friends, but now we're enemies

Pull your knife out of my back, your blood runs black
I was just surprised at how you turned on me so fast
I let you in, I held you close
My blood flows like a river cause I trusted you the most
And now I know it's over (woo-ooh ooooh)
And now I know it's over (woo-ooh ooooh)
And now I know it's over (woo-ooh ooooh)
And now I know it's over (woo-ooh ooooh)

I was so naive, I even let you in my home
Took you out for dinner and let you wear my clothes
I can't even breathe, I have your scent still in my nose
It's like I almost miss you, I should have known

I thought we were friends, but now we're enemies
I thought we were friends, but now we're enemies

Pull your knife out of my back, your blood runs black
I was just surprised at how you turned on me so fast
I let you in, I held you close
My blood flows like a river cause I trusted you the most
And now I know it's over (woo-ooh ooooh)

People are sayin'
That boy is gonna hurt you
His kind of love is not for real
He's only playin'
Foolin' with your heart girl
But I know how he makes me feel

And I don't need any other proof
They just don't understand
They don't know the truth

Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

He's not like the others
Nobody wants to see it
They don't even wanna try
Judge a book by its cover
And you'll never know the story
There's so much more than meets the eye

Oh and I know his heart is true
I don't need anyone
To tell me what to do

Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

My sisters and my brothers
Tell me I should find another
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

Oh but they can't feel his touch
They can't feel his kiss
They don't know what it's like to be loved like this
I don't care about their point of view
'Cause it's understood
When the love is good
Nothin' else is gonna do

Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

My baby down
My baby down
My baby down
My baby down

Momma says he's bad for me
Poppa says I'll be sorry
Everybody's talkin' my baby down
And all my friends doubt him
Tell me I should live without him
Everybody's talkin' my baby down

Hey yo, what's up, man?
Hey yo, you been here all day, man
Y'all been here every weekend, man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first, man!
That's 'cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all
Nigga, my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first
I'm gettin' tired of everybody wantin' to go first, man
You always rap first, I'm rappin'
I don't care what none of y'all say; I'm fresh, I'm fresh

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?

I said who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MCs, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse
I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake
Every diss you can take, personal
We ain't friends tryna make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Man, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man
And said that you can flow?
Point him out! Bitch, I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?!
Point him out! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you can flow?
I wanna know, I wanna know

Now as the summer fades
I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type
But I can make you sway

It makes you burn to learn
You're not the only one
I'd let you be if you
Put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell
Where you end and I begin

[album version:] It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
[music video version (Rihanna):] It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else far away

Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again I don't mind

Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me.)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again I don't mind
'Cause we gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

You can tell one lie a thousand times
But that doesn't make it real
It's a thundercloud of alibis
That empty words cannot conceal

When up is down and wrong is right
In everything you do and say
The truth becomes a shelter when
The storm is on its way
Yes the storm is on its way

The rain is falling
As cold and dark as stone
The rain is falling
It chills us to the bone

The signs are all around us
The writings on the wall
But today the sky grows darker
And the rain will fall

We can build a wall to Heaven's gate
Make tomorrow yesterday
But our tears of rage will break it down
The storm is on its way

The rain is falling
As cold and dark as stone
The rain is falling
It chills us to the bone

Tomorrow we may wake up
And pray we dreamed it all
But today the sky grows darker
And the rain will fall

Facts are fake and friends are foes
And how the story ends nobody knows
Cruel is kind and lost is found
And the truth goes round and round and round and round

The rain is falling
As cold and dark as stone
The rain is falling
It chills us to the bone

One day we may be lifted
High up above it all
But today the sky grows darker
And the rain will fall
Yes the rain will fall
It's coming down, down, down
The rain will fall
The rain will fall
Yes the rain will fall

Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know we reached the heightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]

I let it bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
I line 'em up and watch them fall

[Spoken - Lil Wayne:]
Bang, the shooter name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed, shoot again
I gave her extra rounds
My barrel twist around
I am Mr. Shoot 'em down
I leave hearts on the ground
My love is a weapon
And yes, I use it well
Then I let the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shell
I never shoot and tell
I only shoot to kill
And that vest ain't gonna help ya
Even if it's made of steel
My love is a revolver

[Chorus: x2]

I let it bang, bang
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
I line 'em up and watch them fall
I shoot 'em bang, bang [x2]
I line 'em up and watch them fall

Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
From those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousin' an' snipin'

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your Momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace lovin' guy

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Get that big big big big big big Daddy out the doors
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

If you could see me now
The one who said that he would rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now

If I could hold you now
Just for a moment, if I could really make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now

'Cause I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain
Takin' any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your lovin' arms again

If you could hear me now
Singin' somewhere in the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that hold me tight
If you could only hear me now

'Cause I've been too long in the wind
Too long in the rain
Takin' any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your lovin' arms again

I can almost feel your lovin' arms again.

Two people
Like two children
We're holding back
We're holding on
Two children
Frightened of new places
Of getting lost
Of being found
Running, hiding
Somehow afraid of love
Playing in the sunlight
And shade of love
Games we play too well
Like two children
Isn't it time
Time we throw all our toys away
So that our love can grow
Day by day
We're two people trying to leave
What belongs to some far-off past
Ready to find the love that will last
Are you the one who can free
The child in me...

Healed
Or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine
Have you found a way to escape?
Are you here
Just because I need you?
Can we hole up?
A big freeze is heading our way

We are on a hiding to nowhere
We still hope
But our dreams are not the same, no
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't let the sun in your heart decay

Fight
Or will you show me mercy?
We expelled
The goodness from our hearts
Are you here
Just to prove your winning?
Can we hole up
And ride out this electrical storm?

We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith
But our truths are not the same, no
Don't give up
Don't let the magic leave us
Stop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
Don't you let the sun in your heart decay

Don't give up
Don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Hear me
What words just can't convey
Feel me
I won't let the sun in our hearts decay

When I was fifteen, in my parent's house
I met a good girl when school got out
And I was too scared to tell her how
I loved her still, I loved her still, I loved her still, I loved her still
Well we grew up and we both moved out
We went to, different schools in different towns
And is it, too late to tell you now
I love you still, I love you still, I love you still, I love you still

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
(Summer, summer)

Well I, think back every now and then
So I can sit back, and just pretend
That when you call me, I will tell you how I feel
And I never will, I never will, I love you still
I love you still, I love you still, I love you still

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
(Summer, summer)

Every night before I sleep
I like to think you think of me
Every night before I sleep
I like to think you think of
I think that we should think of
Do you ever think of

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer

Mistakes I made when I was younger
And it's too late to discover
Love at the end of the summer
At the end of the summer
And there are times that I wonder
Is it too late to discover?

A bunch of bright forget-me-nots
Was all I let you buy me
Once upon a summertime just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss in every street cafe
You were sweeter than the blossom on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the major had offered me the key, the key to Paris
Now another wintertime has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chime
You loved me once upon a summertime
Tous les lilas, tous les lilas de mai
N'en finiront, n'en finiront jamais
De faire la fete du coeur

S'aiment, s'aiment

When you fall asleep with your head upon my shoulder.
When you're in my arms but you've gone somewhere deeper.

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace,
Or only to wake and hide your face?

When oblivion is calling out your name,
You always take it further than I ever can.

When you play it hard, and I try to follow you there.
It's not about control but I turn back when I see where you go.

Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?

But oblivion is calling out your name,
You always take it further than I ever can.

When oh oblivion is calling out your name,
You always take it further than I ever can.

Lifting me up, me up, me up, me up
Lifting me up, me up, me up, me up

When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know
You still care for me, say a prayer for me, and I know

Ooh, I like you hanging around
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down
Ooh, you are my favorite sound
'Cause you're always down for

Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go

When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity
Would you hold my hand?
Say you understand my pain

Ooh, I like you hanging around
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down
Ooh, you are my favorite sound
'Cause you're always down for

Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go

It's been a long hard road, and it's only just begun, my friend
And this I know
You helped me carry the load
'Cause you're always down for

Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
Well, you're always around
You're my favorite sound

Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low
When your arms are around me
I don't wanna let you go

I don't wanna let you go
'Cause you lift me up now
Well, you're always around
You're my favorite sound
Lift me up now
You lift me up
Lift me up now
Yeah, you're always around
You're my favorite sound

Tell me, I've got to know
Tell me, tell me before I go
Does that flame still burn
Does that fire still glow
Or has it died out and melted like the snow
Tell me
Tell me

Tell me, what are you focused upon
Tell me, will it come to me after you're gone
Tell me quick with a glance on the side
Shall I hold you close or shall I let you go by
Tell me
Tell me

Are you lookin' at me and thinking of somebody else
Can you feel the heat and the beat of my pulse
Do you have any secrets
That will only come out in time
Do you lay in your bed and stare at the stars
Is your main friend someone who's an old acquaintance of ours
Tell me
Tell me

Tell me, what's in back of them pretty brown eyes
Tell me, behind what door your treasure lies
Ever gone broke in a big way
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say
Tell me
Tell me

Is it some kind of game that you're playin' with me
Am I imagining something that never can be
Do you have any morals
Do you have any point of view
Is that a smile I see on your face
Will it take you to glory or to disgrace
Tell me
Tell me

Tell me, is my name in your book
Tell me, will you go back and take another look
Tell me the truth, tell me no lies
Are you someone whom anyone prays for or cries
Tell me

Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery, but all is fair in love
I have to go away
A writer takes his pen to write the words again
All in love is fair...
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say, to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play...
All is fair in love
I could have never left your side
A writer takes his pen to write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen to write the words again...
That all in love is fair...

When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh

Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

What is this tape?
This is my favorite tape

Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess what? I like that
'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

When the tears come streaming down your face
'Cause you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
What could be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

But high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it show
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

When tears stream down your face
When you lose something that you cannot replace
Oh and tears stream down your face
And I

Oh when tears stream down your face
I promise you I'll learn from my mistakes
When tears stream down your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

She gave me the queen
She gave me the king
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing

She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her deuce was wild
But my ace was high

But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before?
Said she'd never had a full house
But I should have known

From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you

She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card

But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before?
Said she'd never had a royal flush
But I should have known

That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealing out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else
She's got the jack, yeah yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack

Or try to do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on!

[Usher:]
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, Ooh, ooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it

My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Jermaine Dupri:]
Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying You, can't, front
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, Give it to me now, baby

[Usher:]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it

All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad

Oh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (to love you)

You want the world, I'll give you mine
Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door
I could give you so much more

Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
Cause it's the only place you'll see my face

Oh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance?
Cause this may be the last chance (the last chance)
That I get (that I get) to love you (to love you)

But another lonely night might take forever
We've only got each other to blame

'Cause I know what I feel to be right
No more lonely nights
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there
May I never miss the thrill of being near you
And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter
I will do what I feel to be right
No more lonely nights (never be another)
No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

Let's take them back to the future (bars)
Bars, like Paul Rosenberg
The small frozen turd (don't censor me man)
Alright look, I had class, I just got expelled
I excelled at nothing in school
So if you're tryna test my patience it just failed
But King Mathers, I still get hailed
So call me sire, like I exhaled
After I had a deep ass breath held
I guess well, that'll make my size double XL
So kiss your highness's hinded ass
While I'm trying to stretch, it's time to exercise
I'm flexing, isometrics
Twice the reps 'til I get extra-sized
And set my bis and pecs and triceps on fire
Cause I'm coming out guns blazing
Like flaming pythons, my suggestion is parental discretion
Be advised, due to this mental aggression
We advise you to back up, like Byron Leftwich
I'm infectious, I rhyme like I got a sinus infection
A virus, I'm congested and I just ingested
Five Allegras but the side effects from these anti-depressants, they're tryna mess with my mind
I'm a regular Hyde and Jekyll
White with freckles but I silence hecklers
You might wanna head for the fire exits
I'm coming through like a wrecking ball
You would swear I think highly of Miley
And I respect her, the way I backhand her
Excuse my French, Montana, but I am worried about nutting
God damn it, I'm a sexist, I drive a Lexus
Textses out of her mind, and I'm in Texas
With a chainsaw, wait, what did I forget this
Time, oh, my machetes getting upset, he said
He was ready for me to come get him from inside the shed
It was time, he's restless
He wants to make blood shed like a storage unit
But before I do it, let me think this through
Cause if I behead this bitch then I'd be headless
Mic check, one, two
I ain't barely check the mic just yet
And I just sweared like twice as many times
In less than ninety seconds
Than Andrew fucking Dice ever did in his fucking life
But I guess I'm expected to make these kinds of violent records
It's why I keep rhyming reckless
Fuck it, I swear, like a diamond necklace
Since freestyling over phone tap, my line's connected
With rhymes that kept in touch with the fans, that's why the more bars, the better my reception
And I give a fuck about sales, and fuck pop, I don't even like refreshments
Cindy Crawford tryna fend me off with a bendy straw
At the waffle house, awful mouth
But if you don't like what I'm talking about then block me out
Just then Foxy Brown, walks up and knocks me down
Kicks me and socks me, ow
Apparently still mad over what I said last year
On that Vegas track, I just look stupid and stand there
And try to act like I can't hear
What? Sorry dear, but I think Pam Grier just stuck a tampon in my damn ear
That's when my man Denaun Porter ran behind me to pantomime
That if you wanna kick his ass, stand in line
Hands inside my pants as I fantasize taking advantage
Of Brandy and Janet by grabbing my Spanish Fly
Like a blind Hispanic guy with his zipper stuck
Give a fuck, it's all part of my grand design
To get Amanda Bynes to come and fucking blow me like a dandelion
Better watch your step, you 'bout to cross an outlandish mine
I'm what you get if Aaron Hernandez rhymed
So stand aside unless you plan to find out how handy I am with a branding iron
Fuck talking clear so you all can hear
I'd rather rap like a fucking auctioneer
Fuck around and walk from here to the Southpaw premier
Get on Paul's back, rapping Paul Revere
So call me queer, cause I'm always weird
So praise a Genius, hope this don't get taken out of text
But Hillary, I promise to wipe my server clean if you face subpoenas
Got a name that speaks for itself like Anthony Weiner
Hands in between my pants in a theater, jacking my meat
A fan of Trina, Angelina, and Christina and Serena and Selena
Scarlett Johansson, Tiffani Amber Thiessen
Give me a damn good reason and not wanna slip an Ambien in the Cappuccino
And try to have a 3-sum with Janet Reno
I'm fucked worse than Donald Trump
On Lexapro in Mexico across from a Texaco in McDonald's drunk
Broke and out of gas, busted water pump
Getting fondled up by Ronald, feeling him on his rump
Oh yeah, and me and Alyssa Milano hump
We do
Bringing the horror to emcees like the aura of the Run DMC fedora
Addidas and Diadoras but I need at least three to four of those Rita Oras
In a four seater Taurus but tell them my face is the best seat in the house
I'll let them bleed in my mouth while I'm eating them out (that's disgusting, ow Jesus)
Heat seeking missile, duck, demented, sick, hate and see who gives a fuck
I invented prick, and that's a true statement, I see the bitch in you Caitlyn
I keep the pistol tucked like Bruce Jenner's dick
No disrespect though, not at all, no pun intended, that took a lot of balls (ay God damn)
Oh and Azealia Banks just wanna tell you thanks
Now I got trailer skanks sending me ballpark franks in the mail as pranks
And hot pockets, thanks a lot
Awful, I made monopoly off misogyny
Sodomy, how many chocolatey jell-o pops can he possibly lace, walking atrocity
No wonder you scoff at me, it's still obvious I'm as off-putting as Bill Cosby is
Treat women like property, possessive like a noun with an apostrophe
S's, I'd probably stalk broccoli, yes it's
Socrates with a block of cheese and a dollar stuck in this soda pop machine
Got emcees dropping to knees, copping a plea bargain
They keep sobbing, like, “please stop it”
Aftermath, bitch, still Detoxing
Looking for us? We over here
Like we're eavesdropping

Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight...
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight...

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?

I guess I am a jealous lover
'Cause I ain't sharin' with another...

Stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, and money is fine
But you're special, another level

I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you, you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say, What's up?
We both danced to Lucky Star
Eyeing each other, then we're laughin'
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over, girl, what?
Ooh, you are that thunder, lightnin'
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done, but
I think it meant to say in trouble

If it's for you, it can't be any old thing...

You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher

Stress is cruel (stress is cruel)
Fame's a lie (fame's a lie)

It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

Oh Lord we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last 'til the end of time

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
Yes it's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone
Everyone, everyone

Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are corn fields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and moonbeams enough to shine
Oh listen Lord, if You really wanna to know

What the world needs now is love, sweet love, sweet love
It's the only thing that there's just too little of
What the world, what the world needs now is love, sweet love

When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window

I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
As I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And if you should survive to 105

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you will to be
Saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
Move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better

All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well-known tracks

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke
And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows
At Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like, White boys don't know how to rhyme.
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors but man, goddamn, they flew
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice Lamb suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X-Clan debut
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
Exist in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents Black Power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
We was being laughed at You ain't even half black.
You ain't 'posed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
Saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two-time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school if I could pull her
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the Ole Foolish Pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that I apologize
I was wrong 'cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe

So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

They say distance is relative
And relative to relatives I have
I'd say I'm relatively close
To breaking down
Because right now
I feel so alone
I've been missing the elements and
Wishing the elephant in the room
Would leave and kindly close the door
I can't ignore
Him like before
Not anymore

Oh, I miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it all feels to me
So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it feels at six feet

Space and time are interwoven
Or at least that's what we're told
When I was young I was suspicious but it's true
Time sticks like glue
I feel so blue
Here missing you
So I think I'll build a time machine and go back to a time
When we didn't need to measure six feet on the ground
And I came around
That's not allowed
Can't go back now

So I miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how it all feels to me
So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see

There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection

Glad it ain't a toss and everything about me butters

My money is smear and smothered your money you hear me brother
Been about that bread like I was broke or still in the gutter
And in case you ain't know there will be no replacement
And them bags of Arab Money I got stashed in the basement
Face it, whenever I shine, I glisten, and whenever I talk, you listen
Ain't no money getting made in these streets without my permission
I keeps it drug-infested, my money is well connected
It's to the point my conglomerate is well-respected
You need to check my method
I promise you I be the wrong nigga when it comes to my money that you ever want to mess with
Grind like missionary labor, holding dignitary paper
You already know my team is filled with consiglieres, we made you

From the bread to the crib, I know all about the dollar

So wake up, sleepy one

Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you’re here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach)
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach

Slingshots fire into the air)

Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes)

Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender)

All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It’s time to save your world
You’re where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war

So close your little eyes

This time around I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're making me sick

Listen, I've got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'

If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm 'a kill a nigga I ain't jokin'
Indo smoke got me choking
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin'
So I could blow 'em open

This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rotts
Got pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that, baby

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine
Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

Oh yeah! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine

Can I get my glass of tea? Mmm, nothing like it!
At this time I would like very much to do a Folksong. Since Folksongs,
I think are still popular today. Uhm, this one is in Latvian and it's
from Latvia. And it's about this Tahitian girl who uhm, had this lover.
And then one day this lover decides that he doesn't like her anymore
and likes her sister better. So she decided that the only thing to do
naturally was to kill herself, see. So one day, oh, was very nice out
about 75 degrees, and she was taking this walk down to the river to
drown when she, she tripped over this rock see. And uhm, oh it was
awful I mean, she broke her glasses, she scrapped her knees. And uhm,
just at this minute the lover and the sister happen to come by in a
taxicab. So, see they saw her on the floor and she, having an
astigmatism in her left eye, she thought that it was a wild bore. So,
she figured oh boy I'd better get down to the river fast to drown so
she runs down there and what do you know the river was frozen. So I
mean she just stood there you know and she went tchhh, like that. Tch,
and uhm, because, I mean, she couldn't do it that day. See, it was a
small town they only had one river, so. Anyway than she figured, oh
it's getting late, better get home cause her mamma would be worried
and would kill her if she was late for supper you know. So, I mean,
she gets up and she starts walking around home and she bumps in to
this guy, and what do you know, he turns out to be an optometrist.
And just happens to happen to have her suscription. So, anyway, uh?
Oh, I'm sorry suBscription.So anyway, I mean, she's I don't want
you to think that this is one of those Hollywood-like stories: She
gets the glasses and sees happily ever after. I mean, this is, you
know, no like that. I mean she had to pay for the glasses just like
you and me, she ... well, oh well, I mean, I don't want you to think
that I'm lying but she did get about a dollar fifty off, dollar
sixty-five? So anyway, uhm... this guy (Oh) turned out to be very
nice and he even told her where she could find another river.
So, I'll tell you the truth, this girl was a real creep. I mean,
you know who would wanna sing a song about her? I mean, her sister
was really much nicer. And uhm, I mean, I, I think she came from
a better family.

Call me a boob
Call me a schlemiel
Call me a brain with a missing wheel
Call me what you will
But nonetheless I'm still
In love with Harold Mingert
It's not because he has a car
Arnie Fleisher has a car
And a car is just a car
But if Harold didn't have a car too his name
I guess I'd love him just the same
Call me what you will
But nonetheless I'm still
In love with Harold Mingert
And it's not because he has a wealthy family
Arnie Fleischer has a wealthy family
But money isn't everything
And if Harold didn't have a car too his name
I know I'd love him just the same
But sometimes I ask myself why than
Do I than love Harold Mingert
Harold isn't handsome or clever or smart
And I don't find romance and a dance in his heart
The only answers I can think about
Harold Mingert's money and Harold Mingert's car
Call me what you will
But non the less I'm still
In love with Harold Mingert
Also Arnie Fleisher!

This was gonna be the night tonight
I was gonna get to hold you tight
But I guess we didn't plan it right
I never stood a chance, we couldn't dance

Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack

When a little kiss I want to steal
I hit my head against the steering wheel
Now I know the way a pretzel feels
All I can do is shout...Hey let me out!!

Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack

What a way to waste a day with you
Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Let's go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah that's a better place, I like more space

Cause there's , no room to rhumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do what the beat tells you to

We seal the destiny forever

Just one smile on your face
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain

Once upon a time
There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world

Why, Daisy, you're a bloody miracle...
Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue
What magic feats or wizardry and voodoo you can do?
And who would ever guess what powers you possess
And who would not be stunned to see you prove
There's more to us than surgeons can remove
So much more than we ever knew
So much more were we born to do
Should you draw back the curtain, this I am certain
You'll be impressed with you
Well, so long doctor, see you later!

On a clear day
Rise and 1ook around you
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You'll feel part of every mountain sea and shore
You can hear
From far and near
A word you've never, never heard before...
And on a clear day...On a clear day...
You can see forever...
And ever...
And ever...
And ever more. . .

He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin brokin' down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pocket tell you
That you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness

Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead

There's seven people dead

Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born

Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday,
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday,
Into another day again
Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal,
She's not the person that
I though I knew
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue,

Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on
Try to learn the song
But I never do
Oh, Moody blue,
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day
And it's hard to say
Which one is you.

I Have Always Needed Somebody Girl,
But I Close The Doors To Keep Out The World.
But For You, I Would Be Here All Alone,
Locked In A Photograph.
All Of The Clocks Have Run Down.
Lover Beware.
We'll Be The Lovers That Never Were.

I Hang Patiently On Every Word You Send.
Will We Ever Be Much More Than Just Friends?
As For You, You Sit There Playing This Game,
You Keep Me Waiting
When All Of The Clocks Have Run Down,
All Over The World.
We'll Be The Lovers That Never Were.

For As Long As The Sun Shines In Somebody's Eyes,
I Believe In You Baby, So Don't Tell Me Lies.
For As Long As The Trees Throw Down Blossoms And Leaves,
I Know There Will Be A Parade Of Unpainted Dreams.

And I Know Dear, How Much It's Going To Hurt
If You Still Refuse To Get Your Hands Dirty.
So You, You Must Tell Me Something,...I Love You,
Say Goodbye Or Anything.
All Of The Clocks Have Run Down.
Time's At An End.
If We Can't Be Lovers We'll Never Be Friends.

For As Long As The Sun Shines In Somebody's Eyes,
I Believe In You Baby, So Don't Tell Me Lies.
For As Long As The Trees Throw Down Blossoms And Leaves,
I Know There Will Be A Parade Of Unpainted Dreams.

Before the parade passes by

I'm ready to move out in front
Life without life has no reason or rhyme left

I need got a drive again
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again

I'm ready to move out in front

When the parade passes by
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing
When the parade passes by
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing
All of those lights over there
Seem to be telling me where I'm going

And the cymbals crash
And the sparklers light the sky
I'm gonna raise the roof
I'm gonna carry on
Give me an old trombone
Give me an old baton

When there's no hope yet you find the will to try
Why should you fear, need to change
When people want you for who you are
And you can hurt so much it feels a burning scar
Why should you feel
Why should you feel the need to change

When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
There's always somebody waiting
To break your fall
To break your fall

When I can't see, I can't read
When I know love is living inside of me
Why should I feel the need to change
So I spend all my time
Looking for something else
But now it's clear to me
I've learnt my lesson oh so well
Why did I feel
Tell me why did I feel the need to change

And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

That someone somewhere will soon make a change
We're all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

We are the ones who make a brighter day

There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day

Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Chin checker, chin checker
Chin checker, I'm the chin checker, nigga

It was a quarter past 3 when I ran into Rells
Didn't forget my keys, but my name ring bells
A little white tee, some Adidas with the shells
Turn in the coupe, oh shoot, broke a nail
Lemme lemme think what I gotta gotta do
Should I get the black or the chrome 22?
'Cause if a bird try to get out of the cage
One bitch down, New York Times front page
I went to Starbucks, I wanted to get a frappe
Then had a Snapple, apple with the capple
That's Fendi, but that's irrelevant
Threw him a couple Benjis, now I'm the president
I'm Nicki, finicky, so picky
Slick like Ricky, flow be so icky
Now class is finished, you'll be home 'bout 3
Tell all them rap bitches what you know 'bout me, nigga

What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know 'bout me
What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know 'bout me
What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know
They say that girl gettin' money, a lot of dirty money
I'll show you how to do it if you gettin' something for me

Got some nice titties, yes, they wild pretty
That's how I got the S, the five-fifty
That's 'cause I get, I get, I get busy
That's why I don't need you to come get me (no)
I'm badder than the dude at the Neverland
In the money green coupe with the Leprechaun
Holler at him, get a four-leaf clover
Go a- go against me, guaranteed you're over
Look, all the kids sweat Nic like a Mexican (mira, mira)
'Cause I got more kicks than a temper tan—
Trum-trum-trum, you slowpoke
Better rum, rum, rum a little coke
And-a S-M-I-the-L-E
And ain't one thing them could tell me
'Cause I write, write, write my own shit
I'm the one, like I'm the culprit, nigga

What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know 'bout me
What you know' bout me, what you, what you know
They say that girl is a fool, the girl keep on boppin'
The girl get them girls and them girls get it poppin'
What you know 'bout me, what you, what you know 'bout me

Vole vole petite aile
Ma douce, mon hirondelle
Va t'en loin, va t'en sereine
Qu'ici rien ne te retienne

Rejoins le ciel et l'éther
Laisse-nous laisse la terre
Quitte manteau de misère
Change d'univers

Vole vole petite soeur
Vole mon ange, ma douleur
Quitte ton corps et nous laisse
Qu'enfin ta souffrance cesse

Va rejoindre l'autre rive
Celle des fleurs et des rires
Celle que tu voulais tant
Ta vie d'enfant

Vole vole mon amour
Puisque le nôtre est trop lourd
Puisque rien ne te soulage
Vole à ton dernier voyage
Lâche tes heures épuisées
Vole, tu l'as pas volé
Deviens souffle, sois colombe
Pour t'envoler

Vole vole petite flamme
Vole mon ange, mon âme
Quitte ta peau de misère
Va retrouver la lumière

[English translation:]

Fly fly little wing
My dear, my dove
Go far away, go serene
Let nothing here hold you back

Rejoin the sky and the ether
Leave us the earth
Leave misery's coat
Change of universe

Fly fly little sister
Fly my angel, my pain
Leave your body and leave us
To finally stop the pain

Go join the other bank
The one of flowers dans laughs
The one you wanted so much
Your child life

Fly fly my love
Because ours is too heavy
Because nothing eases your pain
Fly to your last trip
Leave your hours exhausted
Fly, you haven't steel it
Become a breeze, be dove
To fly yourself away

Fly fly little flame
Fly my angel, my soul
Leave your misery's skin
Go rediscover the light

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

Ahh! You sick asshole, let me go

Better watch out, sucker, now I got you where I want ya
Onslaught coming and I'm packing in my lunch-a

Man, stop moshin' Marshall; oh my God, ya
Doing the cha-cha and the Cucaracha with a quadra–
Plegic, boogying down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan, lick it while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha'd do to me what it's done?
Such cynicism when there's izm in my system
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lips, son
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo–pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks
Mister – Help me is what he said to me and then sunk
Women, skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin, once

Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place?
Hide 'em in the wall, well, how long will the drywall take?
Well, fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries, for the moment, I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in the back of my damn house, rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin
Vinn, on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you trying to fight? You will never win
Severin' legs, arms; damn, there goes another limb
Pull the lever then; trap door, death is evident

Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill

Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin', so chill
Fuckin' ho, you better fuckin' hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em, and just get to stuffin' those girls
Man, I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her, then I wait, I come back later
Just-a clutching those steel
Blades, baby, when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearing voices like
Wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put ya shish kebab skewers into her
Barbecue her, would you do to her what you usually do
To a girl who's skin's newer?
(In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are)
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya
Boo-yah! Who ya think you're fucking with?
Duck, because here he comes again

Once again, they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts

I traded fame for love without a second thought
It all became a silly game, some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for, wanted it so badly
Went running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now I find I changed my mind
I found a new religion

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love

I travelled 'round the world, looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms, feeling so alone
I had so many lovers who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt fulfilled
And now I find I changed my mind
I found a new religion

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love

I've had a change of heart
I'll make a brand new start
No famous faces, far off places, trinkets I can't buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger, drug that I can't try
No ferris wheel, no heart to steal, laughter in the dark
No one night stand, no far off land, fire that I can't spark

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love
Face the truth
No substitute for love
Substitute for love

Face the truth
No substitute for love
I will wait for you
No substitute for love

Cannot seem to find my way home tonight
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole
Falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone

What would my head be like
If not for my shoulders
Or without your smile
May it follow you forever
May it never leave you
To sleep in the stone,
May we stay lost on our way home

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

If I should die tonight
May I first just say I'm sorry?
For I never felt like anybody
I am a man of many hats
Although I never mastered anything

When I am ten feet tall
I've never felt much smaller since the fall
Nobody seems to know my name
So don't leave me to sleep all alone
May we stay lost on our way home?

For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all he's gotta do is shout

Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like they're gonna touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot, the nights are cold
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears

Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the nightwings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done

I'm coming home, this time I'm gonna stay
I'm coming home and I ain't never goin' away
My feet are itching to get back home
I've had the desert fever since I've been gone
I need some loving so bad that I can't see

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
A coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud

[Instrumental/Solo]

But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know obla-dibla-da
But can you show me where you are?

Make it a sweet, sweet goodbye
It could be for the last time and it's not right.
Don't let yourself get in over your head,  he said.
Alone and far from home I'll find you...

Dead, like a candle you burned out;
Spill the wax over the spaces left in place of angry words.
Scream, to be heard, like you needed any more attention;
Throw the bottle, break the door, and disappear.

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams,
Waiting to say, I miss you. I'm so sorry.

Forever's never seemed so long as when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing.
I could have learned so much from you but what's left now?
Don't you realize you shot this family a world of pain?
Can't you see there could have been a happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams,
Waiting to say, I miss you. I'm so sorry.

Sing me to sleep.
Sing me to sleep.
Sing me to sleep.
Sing me to s...

Sing me to sleep (You've taken so much with you...)
I'll see you in my dreams, (But left the worst with me...),
Waiting to say, I miss you. I'm so sorry.

When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?

When you think it's all said and done
Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?

Bow down
Sell your soul to me

Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously

Cannot resist

Judas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Follow you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of evil man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
Strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons

Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

A place where there is money, a place where there is greed
To bring us all together as a happy family

To live out my own life
And I don't think I know the balance, between what is wrong a right

We stand, we march, we all walk the same line
We are the army of a nation, the army of a nation

When everyone's the same
And everything you know is just the price you choose to pay
And if you wanna go there, I hope you wanna stay
Cause once they let you in you find that there is no escape
I think I see the difference
That everyone's the same
The only alteration, only with another name

I still come home from a long day
So much to talk about, so much to say
I love to think that we're still making plans
In conversations that'll never end
In conversations that'll never end

Courage
Don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So courage
Don't you dare fail me now

Not one to hide from the truth I know
It's out of my hands but I won't let you go
There's no replacing the way you touched me
I still feel the rush

Sometimes it drowns me 'til I can't breathe
Thinking it's only in our memories
But then I talk to you like I did then
In conversations that will never end

Courage
Don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So courage
Don't you dare fail me now

Cause it's not easy
When you're not with me
This world of madness
Goes faster now
And it's a train wreck
But I won't crash yet
Long as your echo
Never fades out

Courage
Don't you dare fail me now

Cause it's not easy
When you're not with me
This world of madness
Goes faster now
And it's a train wreck
But I won't crash yet
Long as your echo
Never fades out

Courage
Don't you dare fail me now

These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied something here inside cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes

Man's got his woman to take his seed
He's got the power - oh
She's got the need
She spends her life through pleasing up her man
She feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Man makes your hair gray
He's your life's mistake
All you're really lookin' for is an even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain
She cries alone at night too often
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Black eyes all of the time
Don't spend a dime
Clean up this grime
And you there down on your knees begging me please come
Watch me bleed.

Only women bleed
Only women bleed
Only women bleed

Only women bleed
Only women bleed

I got my bag, run right home

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

They won't judge me!
They scream and yell and fight all night

I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't judge me!

For so fuckin' long!

They're out to get me

Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed

They push me into a corner just to get me to fight, but
They won't judge me!
They preach and yell and fight all night

They won't break me

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent

And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cause I couldn't stand the pain

I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of life

I feel a change
Back to a better day
Shape shift, hair stands on the back of my neck
Shape shift, in wildness is the preservation of the world 
So seek the wolf in thyself

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I have been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning of wolf and man

And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
You can say it just as good
You're right from your side
I'm right from mine
We're both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Eminem & Dr. Dre:]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, Slim Shady, you a basehead (Uh-uh)
Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted
Well, since age twelve, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, Let's just be friends
Ninety-nine percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steaming mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Jamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting

Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting

What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?

Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting

Go and hide and run away
Run away, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Run away like it's simple
Like it's right...

Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all

Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn

But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm
Still hurting

Remember when I cried to you a thousand times
I told you everything
You know my feelings
It never crossed my mind
That there would be a time
For us to say goodbye
What a big surprise

But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

I remember when it was together 'til the end
Now I'm alone again
Where do I begin?
I cried a little bit
You died a little bit
Please say there's no regrets
And say you won't forget

But I'm not lost
I'm not gone
I haven't forgot

These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend
And I'm not coming back around again
Remember when

That was then
Now it's the end
I'm not coming back
I can't pretend
Remember when

These feelings I can't shake no more
These feelings are running out the door
I can feel it falling down
And I'm not coming back around
These feelings I can't take no more
This emptiness in the bottom drawer
It's getting harder to pretend

Tell her back it up she ass backwards
Sorta I'm a bring it back to my adject
To tell her she can have a sit with my active
She going smoke weed and then she going ash it
Tell that girl don't be getting distractive
Boy! I pull up with your hoe
The voodoo good so I roll it
Thirteen blunts boy I smoke it
Thirteen life boy I know it
Throw four in it when I feeling whitney
All this drinking is killing my kidneys
All this sip I'm sipping going to kill me
And motherfuckers walk like they ridding with me
Two shine in my mouth
Bad bitches all on my couch
You know us for a win a backout
Hit em with a [?] wow-wap she blackout

Nothing's making sense at all.

Such a funny way to fall.

And know I made it home.

So I moved into the city

Find I couldn't hide from changes

3079,Bob Dylan,,"Rambling, Gambling Willie",,"
_x000D_
Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O'Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblin'est man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They're still talkin' about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
I've come to win some money, Gamblin' Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

It was late one evenin' during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

So all you rovin' gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin' now, nobody really knows

6218,Michael Jackson,2004,Scared Of The Moon,The Ultimate Collection,"
_x000D_
Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down!
OK
Guess who's back?
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Whaaaaaaaa

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop!.....Pajama time

Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's OK! [*fart sound*]
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it

Oh baby

Oh baby, baby

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna touch my body

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name girl?
What's your sign?
[Dr Dre] Man, you must be up out your mind
DRE! (AH-AH)
Beer Goggles! Blind!
I'm just tryna unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl
Girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it

Oh baby, baby

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, Save it, boy we got you on tape
yellin' at an old lady to 'Touch my body!'

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
Fellas (WHAT?!) Fellas (WHAT?!)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm callin' all girls

Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin' it's the season
Just go (AH-AH-AH-AH)
It's so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass

I play an old piano from nine till a half past one
Tryin' to make a livin' watchin' everybody have fun
Well, I don't miss much that ever happens on a dance hall floor
Mercy, look what just walked through that door

Well, hello T-R-0-U-B-L-E
What in the world you're doin' A-L-O-N-E?
Say, good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

I was a little bitty baby when my papa hit the skids
Mama had a time tryin' to raise nine kids
Told me not to stare 'cause it was impolite
And did the best she could to try to raise me right

But mama never told me 'bout nothing like Y-O-U
Say, your mama must have been another something or the other too
Say, hello good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well, you talk about a woman I've seen a lot of others
But too much something' and not enough another
You've got it all together like a lovin' machine
Lookin' like glory and walkin' like a dream

Mother Nature's sure been good to Y-O-U
Well, your mama must have been another good lookin' too
Say, hey, good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Well, you talk about a trouble-makin' hunka pokey bait,
The men are gonna love and all the women gonna hate
Reminding them of everything they never gonna be
Maybe the beginning of the World War III
Oh, the world ain't ready for nothin' like a Y-O-U
Well, I bet your mama must have been another something or the other too

Say hey good L-double O-K-I-N-G
I smell T-R-O-U-B-L-E

Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms open hearts
And if it never ends then when do we start?
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you comeback
I have some things to say

How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away

Safe little house, safe little friends,
Safe little thoughts to keep you safe
From all those big bad wolves that eat you up. (Aww shit)

Safe in your room,
Safe as a tomb,
Sleep in a coffin made of glass.
It takes a big facade to hide the cracks.

Can you make this last?
Cause now I'm not so sure,
Are you up to the task?
Sometimes the sickness is the cure.
You're searching so hard,
You've lost yourself...

Does it help you to pray as you're wasting away
Like a silver screen cliche?
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh)
Will it help you to wait for the moment to break,
Is it real or is it fake?
All we are, just chapters on a page.
(Oh oh, oh oh. oh oh, oh oh.)
Cause after all we're actors on a stage.

Hearing you now, shedding the doubts
They'll be no past or future tense.
Regrets a waste of time and plans will change.
(Plans will always change)

Oh, some for the worst,
Some for the best,
You know you can't always get your way.

So worried about what's next,
You lost today.

Can you let yourself,
Can you let yourself,
Will you let yourself,
Will you let yourself let go?
Let go.
Can you let yourself,
Can you let yourself,
Won't you let yourself?
Just let yourself let go.
Let go.

Les enfants qui pleurent
Ne sauront jamais
Ni compter les heures
Ni le temps qu'il fait

J'ai connu Martine
Elle avait treize ans
Quand sonnaient matines
Au clocher du temps

Ma voiture est morte
D'un chagrin d'amour
Et derrière la porte
Je t'attends toujours

J'ai quitté l'école
Pour courir la mer
Mais la mer est folle
Et bientôt c'est l'hiver

Les enfants qui pleurent
Ne sauront jamais
La moitié de ce que je sais

We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm

The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly
Heading for the light

I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

We held each other
Praying for a spark
Two crazy partners
Scrambling in the dark

Now where are we going
Searching in the night
We had a feeling
It's going to be alright

I can't see anymore
The blinding light
It's just a metaphor
I use when things aren't going right

Two crazy partners
Searching in the night
We've got a feeling
It's going to be alright

We follow blindly
Heading for the light
We've got a feeling
It's gonna be
It's gonna be alright

We came from nowhere
Hiding from a storm
We cling together
To keep each other warm

The road to somewhere
Stretches through the night
We follow blindly

You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

I'm so en-captured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace

He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim

Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim

W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
S on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him

Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me mama, lil' mama, I call him baby

Shorty, I'ma only tell you this once, you the illest

And for your loving, I'ma die hard like Bruce Willis

He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band
Just left Money Gram in the lemon Lamb'
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam

I mean that nigga must be from the motherland
Anyway, I think I met him in the sky
When I was a Geisha, he was a Samurai
Somehow, I understood him when he spoke Thai

Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
S on my chest, let me get my cape on

He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon

Convict just like Akon

'Cause you know the snitches be putting the jake on

Someone's gone out fishing
Someone's high and dry.
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei.
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why.

You and me together
Nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

Some boat's on the ocean
We're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump, in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
Such a beautiful night for love
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

Yeah, it's a beautiful night
Yeah, it's a beautiful night

Yeah, beautiful night, beautiful night
Yeah, it's such a beautiful night, beautiful, beautiful night

Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night

Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me

All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life…
The war that never ends

Father please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life…
The war that never ends

We'd like to leave you now with a number called See What A Fool I've Been.

Well, she's gone, gone this morning.
See what a fool I've been.
Oh, Lord.
I said, What a fool I've been.

I got a train, I come outta a train to Georgia.
Sixteen-coaches long.
Oh, Lord.
I said, Sixteen-coaches long.

Sure it had.
Alright.

My dog is too hungry
It just, it just kept on barking.
Oh, he said he just don't feel the same
Oh, Lord
He said, Just don't feel the same.
He said, I don't
He said, I don't
He said, I don't feel the same.
Oh, but...
Come on.

Well, she's gone, gone this morning.
See what a fool I've been.
Oh, Lord.

—Merry Christmas, everybody—
I've been.

Thank you. Goodbye.

Still I recall all the good times together
The love we shared, the fun and the laughter
How I wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
I miss you and I wish you were here

Dreams that I had they lay broken in sorrow
The plans I made the hopes for tomorrow
If I could I would tell you I'm lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here

All through the night I will see memories passing
The way you looked the sound of your laughing
How I long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here

Please don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see

Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me
If we're not careful turns into reality

But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

And God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light ... light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away

Yes, it's still lonely having
Just her picture here with me
And I know I just can't stand it anymore
I'm gonna leave right now 
and go back where I ought to be
Goin' home to the girl that I adore

Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away

Well, every time I hear 
her sweet voice on the telephone
Then I know I just can't stand it another day
I'm gonna call right back
And tell her that I'm coming home and stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home and stay

Something's burnin' I can't figure out what
(Out what) it's either lust, or a cloud of dust, judgment is clouded must
Just be the powder from the power of
(Love) but I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get outta
Left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan and the further I walk the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard, 'cause after all this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to busta, bust her, the thought's scary yo, though and it hurts-brace
Hope it ain't here we go, yo 'cause my head already goes to worst-case scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though, should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date, could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First No [*slurp*], you don't [*slurp*] under—[*slurp*]—stand [*slurp*]. I [*slurp*] don't [*hic*] do [*slurp*] this for anyone ever.
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé, 'til you sucked on Wayne, André and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil' Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e, Polow Tha Don, Dre
Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-God dang Jigga on, eh?
'Cause your name I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'
The game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me, like she never did before
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
I told that bitch

I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water he drowned, like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya'
Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And, Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels ya little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me. Fuck ya think? We're gonna get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy God mama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day... Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im
His mouth piece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous
As Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasing her.
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her, pity the fool and pity the fool in me I'mma live with the
Game of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me, like she never did before
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
And I told her: go where you wanna go, go do what 'cha wanna do, I don't care
I told that bitch

So needless to say, I'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off 'Wee-Bey' from the Wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ, each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display, is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-Day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes, that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin' 73 thank
God there's an exit comin' up, what the mother F-U-C-K's
Wrong with her, hit the off-ramp, 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt, hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me, OK, you wanna fuck with me 'eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave
And created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved (the fuck?)
Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray, durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict I guess
That's why I'm so clingy every girl I've ever had either says
I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin' dramatic, man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just
A fuckin' romantic, I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, Hit the road, and after she left I sent that bitch a text
I said, Be careful driving. Don't read this and have an accident! She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect- no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case, than the model covered in L'Oréal and Mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories, for story telling, while the whore was yelling rape
'Til her vocal cords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates
Of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of
[*Phone ring*] wait, Dinner at eight?
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of love

Through it so many times (with women that I do it for)
Ain't trying to make you mine (but I like the feeling)
Let's both be honest here, baby
We don't go through drama here, baby
'Cause when you give it up
You gon' get addicted and go crazy and lose your mind
How many of you like that?

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties

I tell people, you just going through changes
And that you're acquainted both with night and day
That your money's good and you just being courageous
On them burning bridges knowing your feet are made of clay
Well I say you won't be destroyed by your inventions
That you brought it all under captivity
And that you really do have all the best intentions
But you're making a liar out of me

Well I say that you just young and self-tormented
But that deep down you understand
The hopes and fears and dreams of the discontented
That threaten now to overtake your promised land
Well I say you'd not sow discord among brothers
Nor drain a man of his integrity
That you remember the cries of orphans and their mothers
But you're making a liar out of me
But you're making a liar out of me

Well I say that, that ain't flesh and blood you're drinking
In the wounded empire of your fool's paradise
With a light above your head forever blinking
Turning virgins into merchandise
That you must have been beautiful when you were living
You remind me of some old-time used-to-be
I say you can be trusted with the power you been given
But you're making a liar out of me

So many things so hard to say as you stumble
To take refuge in your offices of shame
As the earth beneath my feet begins to rumble
And your young men die for nothin', not even fame
I say that someday you'll begin to trust us
And that your conscience not been slain by conformity
That you stand up unafraid to believe in justice
But you're making a liar out of me
You're making a liar out of me

Well I can hear the sound of distant thunder
From an open window at the end of every hall
Now that you're gone I got to wonder
If you ever were here at all
I say you never sacrificed my children
To some false god of infidelity
And that it's not the Tower of Babel that you're building
But you're making a liar out of me
You're making a liar out of me
Well you're making a liar out of me

He's your uncle, not your dad
He's the best friend you ever had
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts
Just remember Pearl Harbor

The Alamos and nothing could be worse

He's your favorite relative
And he needs a lot to live
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed
And he'll send back what he don't need

If you're not in form, ten-forty's your salvation
By deprivation of temptation
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?

When he calls you as he may do
Don't be frightened, red white and blue
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad
He's your uncle, not your dad

If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver
The food is lousy up the river
It's give and take and he does all the taking
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me?

Life has two things you can't subtract
Death and taxes to be exact
So just pa-pa-patriotically declare
He's your uncle, he's your uncle, not your dad

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

The hardest part this troubled heart has never yet been through now
Was to heal the scars that got their start inside someone like you now
Boy, had I known or I'd been shown back when how long it'd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm and all but would erase me
I never would hope that I could, no matter what you'd pay me
Replay the part, you stole my heart, I should've known you're crazy
If all I knew was that with you, I'd want someone to save me
It'd be enough, but just my luck, I fell in love and maybe

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better

So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution
This melody inside of me still searches for solution
A twist of fate, the change of heart cures my infatuation
A broken heart, to provide the spark for my determination

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better

I never wanted you to be so full of anger
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
Now we all know better

All that I wanted was

If I were you, I'd manage to avoid the invitation
Of promised love that can't keep up with your adoration
Just use your head and in the end, you'll find your inspiration
To choose your steps and won't regret this kind of aggravation

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out
Ringing in my ears

Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry

Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
'Cause ev'ry time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight

Don't cry daddy

I think I've been the devil since the day that I turned one
Like when I stole your money just to buy a pack of gum
I know it wasn't funny, can't believe I was so dumb
I blame it on my age but even now I'm not so young
I'm still stuck in my ways I can't believe what I've become
Somehow you feel the same I guess it's motherly love
Motherly love

Wish I could find the piece in me
See the good things that you see
It's not that easy

But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes

I can't believe you love me after all the things I did
Like when I said I hated you when we were in Madrid
Like when I didn't answer you cause I was on the road
But you cooked my favorite dinner for me right when I get home
I blame it on my stress cause I've been feeling so high strung
I'm looking for excuses and I know that isn't one
Somehow you feel the same I guess that's motherly love

In June of forty-three there was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called the G.O.U.
Who did not feel the need to be elected

They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Atilla the Hun
A bomb or two and very few objected

Yeah, just one shell and governments fall like flies, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet rule as democracy dies

The lady's got potential, she was setting her sights
On making it in movies with her name in lights
The greatest social climber since Cinderella

OK, she couldn't act but she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella to be stellar

Yeah, just one shell and governments lose their nerve, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Backs to the wall, aim high
We're having a ball
That's how we get the government we deserve

Now the man behind the President calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Peron, would-be dictator

He began in the army out in Italy so
Saw Mussolini's rise from the very front row
I reckon he'd do likewise sooner or later

Yeah, just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain, kapow, die
They haven't a chance, bye bye
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Peron was biding time out in the slow lane

Yeah, suddenly an earthquake hit the town of San Juan, kapow, die
They stumble and fall, bye bye
Keep away from the wall
But one guy was having a ball
The tragedy, a golden chance for Peron

He organized a concert with incredible flair
In aid of all the victims, such a grand affair
Politicians, actors, stars of every flavor

It was January twenty-second, 1944
A night to remember, yeah, that's for sure
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva
For that's the night that Peron first met Eva

Don't give our secret away, be careful what you say
If you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
If you walk in your sleep forget where you came

Forget where you came, now
Forget where you came
Don't mention my name
Don't mention my name
Forget where you came

Well, it's hard to be a gambler
Bettin' on the number
That changes ev'ry time
Well, you think you're gonna win
Think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find
Yeah, it's hard to figure out
What she's all about
That she's a woman through and through
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue,

Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on
Try to learn the song
But I never do
Oh, Moody blue,
Tell me who I'm talkin' to
You're like the night and day
And it's hard to say
Which one is you.

Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday,
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday,
Into another day again
Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal,
She's not the person that
I though I knew
She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue,

Oh, Moody blue
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hangin' on
Try to learn the song
But I never do
Oh, Moody blue,
Tell me who I'm talkin' to

Simple interaction is all that I crave

Hi! Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello, hi!
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

I'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
Spasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat-lined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – listen
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, 'cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shred the skin
Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!
It's probably AIDS! Forget it then.
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello?!
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a mini thin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy

Hi, something's not right

Cocaine by the pound

Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day,
True player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(Say what)
I think about the girl all the time
(wow wow)

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides,
Ain't no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas

By no means average
It's always she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten,
I wanna get in
Let me come in,
So I can win

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, 'bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

She's got class and style
And balance by the pound,
Shorty, never act wild
Very low key on the profile

Catching feelings is a No,
Let me tell you how it goes
Curves the words,
Spins the verbs
Lovin' it curves
So freak what you heard

Rollin' with the phatness
You never quite know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way

I like the way you work it
Top notch, trumped tight, every day,
You're blowing my mind,
Baby, in time
Maybe I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I'm 'bout to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I'm 'bout to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I'm about to bag it up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on play on

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
No no no

'Cause I'm gonna pop some tags
As only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is freaking awesome

Now I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is freaking awesome

Now, now I'm gonna pop some tags

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest
The smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic-depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick-ass, the first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet, another Valium, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day, I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places, baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling? Vrumm-vrumm
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum-drum
A head and torso of someone; where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blonde hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly, there's somethin' wrong, 'cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now, everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on!

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your life’s an open book
Don’t close it ’fore it’s done
The brightest flame burns quickest
That’s what I heard her say
A son’s heart’s owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

“Rebel,” my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I’m coming home
I’m not all you wished of me
A mother’s love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone’s all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Delivering words that fall on deaf ears
It's such a big wheel to try and turn

Would it keep you awake if the gun you love was turned at you one day?

And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules.

With time the child draws in.
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own,
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.

What I've felt,
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown.
Never be.
Never see.
Won't see what might have been.

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all –
This bitter man he is.

Throughout his life the same –
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win –
A tired man they see no longer cares.

The old man then prepares
To die regretfully –
That old man here is me.

We said forever, but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye

Underneath the lights of the motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night and day, ay, oh
I miss you every single way, ay, ay
We said forever, but forever wouldn't wait for us

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I wanna know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you
How could I let you go?

You were the best thing, ever happened to me
And I'll keep on fighting just to make you believe

You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye
I wanna know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you
How could I let you
Don't wanna let you
I'll never let you go

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Ah

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high

Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming,
I can hear them say

Carry on my wayward son,
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man,
Well, it surely means that I don't know

On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune,
But I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more no!

Carry on,
You will always remember
Carry on,
Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry,
Don't you cry no more,

No more!

Tellin all the other girls that you’re still with me
You may think its funny hunnie

Keep on going, you just gotta fight it
Keep on going cause it's not too late
You can't back down, you can't back down
[2x]

[Verse 1:]
They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit thats been thrown at me
or am I just a little snappy
and they genuinly care
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and I continuosly stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow I know you're near me in presence
or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this
but Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if its true, how the fuck am I supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Anna]
Keep on going, you just gotta fight it
Keep on going cause it's not too late
You can't back down, you can't back down
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
Doody, thats what we call eachother
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about eachothers skin colours
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
when I look over and his shirt is off
I'm like you gon fry and like
No I wont, I'm black stupid
black people they got melatonin
in their skin, we don't burn
meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
like I'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
and I still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well Nate finally got em back shit
it must have been at least 16 years ago
well I put em in your cask-owww
moving past it, it still aint registered yet
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
the motor city mo-town
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Anna]
Keep on going, you just gotta fight it
Keep on going cause it's not too late
You can't back down, you can't back down
[2x]

[Verse 3:]
and this may sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
and as for all of me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our General just fucking died in our lap
we shut off all our pages,
all our cell numbers is changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta pressing on
don't ever give up the dream dog
I got love for you all
and Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on Dresden
from making cars to paintballing
getting arrested
to sitting across from eachother in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating
me, you and whats his face
I forgot his fucking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fucking face
and thats on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you once more
difficult as it sounds

[Hook: Anna]
Keep on going, you just gotta fight it
Keep on going cause it's not too late
You can't back down, you can't back down

Life, it can twist your heart
Put you in the dark
I was cold and lonely

Doubt, it can close you in
Build the walls within
I let fear control me
And that girl didn't know
Where the answer would be

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking for it somehow
Somewhere we couldn't see

But the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

Ummm

Faith, it can lift you up
And if you got enough
To reach a new beginning

Love, can withstand strong
In the final hour
We'll find the joy in living

Don't let go
Cause that I know
Pretty soon you will see

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking for it somehow
Somewhere we couldn't see

But the love was always there
It's been around us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

You are my tomorrow
There's safety in your arms
Where you'll go I'll follow
'Cause you're the world where I belong

Right in front of you
In front of me
Somehow we couldn't see
Right in front of you
I had to fall to finally see

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking for it somehow
Somewhere we couldn't see

But the love was always there
Surrounding us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see

Right in front of you
Right in front of me
We were looking for it somehow
Somewhere we couldn't see

But the love was always there
Surrounding us everywhere
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

I finally see... yeah
I had to fall to finally see
That you were right in front of me

All the things you've said
And the things you've done
Can you carry it with no regrets
Can you stand the person you've become
Ooh there's a light [x2]

[Chorus:]
Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living

Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust and memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see
Oooh there's a light [x2]

[Chorus:]
Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake
The weight of living

It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes [x4]

[Chorus:]
Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake
The heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake

Short desire warms my heart

She said she wanna give it up, oh
She said she wanna turn my life all around
She said she wanna play the game
I love it when you say my name
I love it when you say you want me around

The rain is coming down
And the wind is blowing us and it's you

You're my world, yea girl
I will always be with you tonight

Ooh, I just wanna fall tonight with you

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Eminem as Stan:]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, No
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
You would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.
We should be together, too

Dear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins In the Air Tonight
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim,—shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up. See, I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?
I say that shit's just clowning , dawg
C'mon! How fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was... it was you
Damn!

I'll still sing a song
Of you in September

So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was

I asked her for her hand
Said, Would you like to dance?
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love

Just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true

The magic in your eyes
Made me realize
That everything I feel
Has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

Play another slow jam

For me and for my baby
Play another slow jam

I can give my good loving to

Stay away leave me alone
Stay away from my door
'Cause you'll hurt me again like you hurt me before
Don't want no excuses
I don't want no more lies
I don't like crying
So I keep it inside
Do me a favor, for God's sake,
Please, stay away, stay away!
Stay away out of my dreams
Stay away from my nights
You're there in the darkness
So I need no other lights
I don't want no whisky
'Cause it brings back the pain
Makes me call you at midnight
And beg you to come back again
Do me a favor, for God's sake,
Please, stay away, stay away!
'Cause time is just too short
To waste it on regrets
They say it heals a broken heart
That's waiting to forget
Oh, stay away, leave me alone!
Stay away from my door,
'Cause you'll hurt me again
Like you hurt me before
But if you should need me
Don't think it's all right
Don't think you can call me up
In the middle of some lonely night
'Cause if I see you
I' m afraid I might say
Don't stay away
So, stay away!

Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem.
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, I heard the hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, God is in heaven
And we all want what's his
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I'm gazing out the window
Of the St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Baby loves, I'm tryna talk to you
There's a boy
And I don't quite know
What to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me, shows me, he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'd rather wait for him forever
Instead of having him just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do

Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I am dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

No
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand

Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame 
And holds me down until it is through
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, still I stand

And hate is a train
That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again

Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand

Oh, still I stand

Lipstick has a way of leaving more than just a mark on my sheets,
Coloring my senses cherry red; at least for this week...
Kisses under starry night skies, talked about in song,
We play along, so bitter sweet by our design.
I'm sick and tired of writing songs about you,
This is it, this is the end...

Take off your makeup and put down the camera,
Choke on the drama that makes me want to,
Tear up the pictures, the pages you've saved,
Creating a life of trends and make believe...

I've got no place in my heart for a criminal like you to dwell,
In this endeavor, make this last forever...
I'm just delirious,
You can't be serious,
You're so infamous for leaving me a mess...

Take off your makeup, put down the camera,
Choke on the drama that makes me want to,
Tear up the pictures and pages you've saved,
Creating a life of trends and make believe...

She gets what she wants and she breaks what she gets,
Get out while you can or she'll tear you to pieces

Get out while you can or she'll tear you to pieces
Are you having a good time sweetheart? )

Take off your makeup, put down the camera,
Choke on the drama that makes me want to,
Tear up the pictures and pages you've saved,
Creating a life of trends and make believe...

Carry on home,
I'll be waiting miles and miles away,
Leaving you to be forever seventeen,
Cleaning up the messes that you've made.

Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me 
So scratch my itch and beat my drum 
So i can start to begin what's begun

Filling up my heart with golden stories

Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up

Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he lightly touch down?
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and he clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance.

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him but just travelled all about
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance.

He said, I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips.
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars, 'cause I drinks a bit
He shook his head, yes, he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, Please,

So not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps of my dad
'Cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man
If you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em I'm

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Why do I feel this way)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans
But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is whack
This is more than I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein'
Everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceeing
It's fuckin' crazy
'Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
But instead I forced us to live alienated, so I'm sayin'

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Hollywood)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
(Why do I feel this way)
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood

Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood
(Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me, when I'm gone for good
(This shit is not for me)
So goodbye, goodbye Hollywood
(I'm not a fuckin' star)
Please don't cry for me, when I'm gone for good
(I'm goin' back home)

About this girl

[Justin:]
Come in right here?

[Pharrell:]
Yea, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to

Ah, ah, arms...

Some days, things just take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm

Sometimes it's hard to find, find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time when things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

667,Alec Benjamin,,I Built A Friend,,"
_x000D_
I built a friend with three pieces of plastic and a pen
I made him on the table in the den
I gave him my old cell phone for a head, for a head
And we spent holidays at my house
And we left presents in a stocking
And we bought bolts and things and strings
And a new watch, that's what he got

And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

Then I left for college in September
And we wept cause we can't be together
So I kept pictures to remember my old friend, my old friend
Then I met this girl at graduation
And forget my oldest creation
And I guess I'll see him next vacation
Send my best, I send my best

And we had so much fun together
We knew we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

I came home to find him on the table
With a note, scribbled out in pencil
And he wrote, that he just wasn't stable all alone, all alone
Next to him, an empty glass of water
That he spilled, all over the body
That I built, it fizzled and it popped
And then it killed, and then it killed

And we had so much fun together
We thought we'd be friends forever
And we had so much fun together
We had so much fun

I built a friend

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here)

Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become

Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
What d'you do? and Who d'you know?
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
(Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there

'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, Yes, I suppose

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, We did it
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him 
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

All things go, all things go

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells and insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart
This is the beat of my heart

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world and bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives and often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

The fear of falling apart
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Swim the deepest sea, e-e-e

Show her that you're sure

This Big Meech from the richest black muthafucking gang in the world
My nigga always say, there’s only two things a nigga can do for you
You either got time or money, can’t have em both
Nigga with money, don't have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money
We don’t have a lot of time around here – cause time is money

[Verse 1 - Akon]
Give me one minute, cause you tripping
Too much time on your hands, you slipping
Why you focused on all this dealing?
When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?
Crib on the hill: now that’s good living
Harder to reach when you make your first million
So much money gotta stack to the ceiling
And I’mma keep doing this forever, God-willing
Real niggas like me don’t catch feelings
Only broke niggas be out there grilling
Say you getting money but you ain’t even tipping
A big-booty girl in front of you dipping
Fronting like you really doing all that shipping
Man you gotta be, gotta be kidding
Don’t even try cause my weapon is hidden
My nigga is ready to do some killing

[Hook - Akon]
I’mma tell you just one time: give me what’s mine
Cause I don’t have time to waste
I’ll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I won’t stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don’t know if you really got what it takes
Hustling’s in my blood and it just won’t go away
Time, money, time, money

Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money

[Verse 2 - Akon]
‘Kon live in one year, made millions
Everybody got money: nigga, we chillin
Ain’t got no time: it’s some bad feelings
Especially when you want a little sexual healing
Girlfriend’s pulling, family’s pulling
In every direction, everybody need money
My lifestyle redefine how they all living
If I keep it up I’ll be broke in a minute
My kinfolk’s on the block and they dealing
All my goons are still out there killing
Man I be running, got no time to be skipping
Trying to hit a home run in the 9th inning
Meech locked up, copped out, for a killing
Taking care of mine, San Quen chilling
That’s my homie, you can trust that nigga
Just a matter of time before I get back with him

[Hook - Akon]
I’mma tell you just one time: give me what’s mine
Cause I don’t have time to waste
I’ll be on my grind, money on my mind
And I don’t stop getting paid
Living this life of mine
I don’t really know if you really got what it takes
Hustling’s in my blood and it just won’t go away
Time, money, time, money

Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money

[Verse 3 - Akon]
Gotta look out for haters if you wanna be blockin’
Look out for stick up kids that be robbin’
Look out for ladies with their hands in your pocket
If you don’t, you’ll be the next hot topic
Don’t wanna be the next one dropping
6 feet deep like conans coffin
I’d rather see you out there flossing
Love to see another brother getting it poppin
Chase that paper, don’t you wait up
Get your money nigga, fuck them haters
Everybody complain about your time
You ain't got none? Find a way to make it up later
Cause I ain't got time for all that
And you ain't got time for all that
And I don’t wanna waste your time
On behalf of BMF bring Meech back!

Time is money, time is money
Time is money, time is money
Time money, time money
time is money
Time money, time money

Nigga with money, don’t have no time
Nigga with time, don’t have no money
Nigga with money, don’t have no time

5187,Guns N' Roses,1991,Don't Damn Me,Use Your Illusion I,"
_x000D_
Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words, once heard, they can place you in a faction
My words may disturb, but at least there's a reaction
Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah
Sometimes I wanna kill, sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even, sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give, sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while, I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen, didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world, I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely, I fell down when I was blind

So, don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you?
And how can I ever make you see that
Deep inside, we're all somebody
And it don't matter who you, you wanna be?

But now I gotta smile, I hope you comprehend
For, this man can say it happened 'cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world, I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime

But look at what we've done to the innocent and young
Whoa, listen to who's talking 'cause we're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
Said, it tears into our conscious thoughts, you tell me, who's to blame?

I know you don't wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusion
But your delusions are yours, and not mine
We take for granted, we know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover and read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me and don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my intentions, can you find the missing link?
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time

So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and I've never pretended
As so many others do, intending just to please
If I damned your point of view, could you turn the other cheek?

Oh
Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
'Cause I've been where I've been and I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me

Don't damn me
I said, don't damn me
I said, don't hail me
Ah, don't damn me
Ouh

Smoke 'em if you got 'em
Alright, that sucked

Love is a burning thing
Can change into a firy ring
Bound for wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

They say that love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire

5089,Eminem,,Echo(2010-version),,"

[Chorus:]
Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

[Eminem:]
I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling

[Eminem:]
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
The only fucking thing that you consume is time
I'm super human, my world is like a Rubik's cube
It's too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
My mentality's caveman stupid woman
My life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
So pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'm a lay here just spooning yo
Oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
Diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
Rotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down to my soul, from my head to my toe...
Ever since I was thirteen I learned how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
Cause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'm a set this bitch on fire
And this time I don't mean I'm a pour gasoline on some chick and light her
Cause this time when I fuck this world I'm put my whole God-damn dick inside her
I ain't even put my tip in that hoe yet
I'm go get Nickel and try to rip it wider

[Chorus:]
Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Classical poems
Battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
Bad as I need a horn
Stabbing my clavicle bone
I'm matador prone
First time I seen a desert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
The 44 pop
First time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
Looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
In order to clean my veins you need saline
I'm never referring to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang vroom
Get respect from the get-go, hello
Set to the echo, psycho
Pen got a mind of it's own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
As the echo follows the Maserati
As the petrol swallows,
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
Check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,
Right now I'm living a dream
Though we may be reckless
The ladies check us
They whisper Shady Records
Baby echo

[Chorus:]
Oh, all around the World,
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Here we both stand as it slips through our hands

We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall

Moments we care are never enough
Clinging to pride, heads held high
What we truly feel, we push to the side

Moments we gained are moments we lose
We're just giving time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Yet we stand as it slips through our hands

We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall

Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)

Your mama sent us horoscopes (horoscopes)
Had so much fun watching them unfold (watch them unfold)
You said she like me, I smiled, I know
So when they ask, How's life? I go (sheesh, sheesh)

When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh, oh
Talking about what you wanna do, whatever's wrong or right
I am followin' you 'cause you make me say oh, oh
Say, I don't know what I'd do without you in my life, it'd be so sour
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours

When life deals us cards
Make everything taste like it is salt
Then you come through like the sweetener you are
To bring the bitter taste to a halt

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh, oh (sheesh, sheesh)
You make me say oh, babe

Deep in the night I remember,
That I'm reaching for you
Wanting to turn to you,
That's all I want, oh, so much, deep in the night
I need you to touch me
Deep in the night
I wait for day light,
Day times I always get through
But when the sun goes down,
That's when I feel cold and old,
Deep in the night
I need you to hold me
Read a book and I think about you
Put it down and I think about you
I make some coffee and I think about you
Wash out the cup and I think about you
Wind the clock and think about you
Turn out the light and I think about you
Then I punch the pillow and I think about you
Deep in the night I get lonely
Why didn't I try someone new?
It didn't work out!
I know,
Don't I know, don't I know
Because I tried, I tried
Deep in the night
I need you beside me
Deep, so deep in the night...

Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life

Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

Never would give you away
You'll be unfamiliar with pain
You'll never cry

I've been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that I'm not about that life

I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought it'd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together (yeah)

Repeat what you already did

Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, Te extraño
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
'Cause I cared too much to see you cry

And I know I'll wanna stay

And I'll be on my way

We said goodnight at your door
I didn't get far 'cause here we are
And I'm still begging for more

Whilst the millionth and the last time
Slowly disappears from sight
For the millionth and the last time

A lot of people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody that I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that then I'll kill you
You know why?
'Cause I'm a criminal

Criminal
You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
Hate fags? The answer's yes

Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfucking balls
You'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum
You'll never get hold of 'em

Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail.
Get it? Checking the 'male'?

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
C'mon! Relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen. A-men!

Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital

Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing
'Cause I watch TV, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fucking retards
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-A-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word

My mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby 'cause that baby was me

I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger

I drink more liquor
To fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word
My morals went ... when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Now don't ignore me
You won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him

Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
The Maniac's in in place of the doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather
So I'm taking his place

Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal

Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Aight
I'll be right here waiting on you
Aight
Yo Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright. Goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fucking nerves
Aha?
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!
What? Oh my God, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around
Don't kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me, don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you!
Go, go, go!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes

Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet

If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfucking chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask

Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word fucking ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal

S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial (Skrrt, yeah)

I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
Oh, what a bundle of joy
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

My name's Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man

So give me more, more

And I ain't paying my rent this month

But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
Dancehall life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money 'cause today's payday
And if you're a G, you a G, G, G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more

I don't wanna talk about it [8x]

I see ahead of me a light that takes my breath
If we're only ever looking back, then how can we expect
To see each other as we are, for all that we've become
Would be friends at all if we weren't friends when we was young?
And I want to feel close to you for more than just a sake,
Of the place that we grew up in and all them times that we got baked in the park
Look, if you take me apart, you'll find half of me is you but half of me is asking me to start anew

You look the same but I don't recognize you,
I'm looking you dead in the face and I can't find you
Don't like the way we always talk in the past tense,
Can't explain the present 'til you work out what the past meant

These are the days that bind us together, forever
And these little things define us, forever, forever

All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

There's a man I've known for years, and still to this day do I know him
I love him very much, it's very hard for me to show him
Back then and even now I feel there's something that I owe him
And that feeling should be going over time but no it's growing
We was kid mates, making mistakes, playing give take
Big hearts battling them big snakes, rattling their tails
He was like the wind in my sails, I was like the water for his keel, it was real
It use to hurt my flesh that his worn scars were heated still
He use to hurt his flesh just to see if he could feel
He took out a long straw, he was never really the strong sort
Got into the wrong sport, big swigs, long snorts
Caught in that spiral, saw attempts to help him sparkle
But soon he got so down that he got on the brown, word got around
People did not like the sound, they told me to stop popping round to see him
I kept disagreeing, soon he was a different being
He got into stealing, robbing, I still see him frequent afterwards you'd think would open eyes were throbbing
You could stop him freaking out, but to speak about the things that made him weak, his doubt
And to stop his rolling sentence, faced with paper pen to write his actions spoke dependence
Friendship became difficult to say the least, he played the beast so well
I wondered how I would ever make our peace
That's when we drifted, never argued, it just became clear
The parts of him I loved so well would slowly disappear

Those are the days that bind us together, forever
These little things define us, forever, forever

All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm going to find you and take it slowly

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
I'm going to find you and make you want me

You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I’ve been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you’re spinning my track
That’ll knock you off your feet

Monkey see what monkey do
But I’m a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And alonestar backing me up
We won’t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on

This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who d'you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow - blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed - keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise up

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took so long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on

And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say...

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway...

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine...

Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year
Happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try

Shady, we're back

Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
You better just make new living arrangements
If you think you're the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is, I'm best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name no, ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z
Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe they'll name me
Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
Yo, his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad-I-o
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big-big-big-big-b-baby

So maybe the 80s made me crazy, I been tryna get my weight
Up since the Ace Slim Shady gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day, replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the a fey at 18, 8 years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream so

Shady (Stat Quo!), we're back

This is what I eat, sleep, and breath and feed my kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block, fought with my rocks and squeeze
Critics expecting me to under achieve
I just deal with the hate I receive by rollin' back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze I bring him right to his knees?
And tell him suck my dick, take a bow and leave with a sack full of unmarked cheese, I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed to be Gs and claim they runnin' shit, nigga I run me, I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me, that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be asking where I be, dawg I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it drink my pee
Record song for the Detox LP, feet don't fail he, niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Bellvee?
I'm 'a die wealthy, boss in the game, what the fuck they goin' tell me, A-Town's entrée, Aftermath Shady

Shady (Bobby Creek!), we're back

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
(None of them) stand a chance, at the dance without a bowtie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga, I'm just living me
We the reason for the season
So I'm breezing through the track, nigga

Shady

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected getting weight from MS 13
With S.K.'s, A.R.'s and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, Ds and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back

It's only cus the sun shined once again
Now the party's on
Everybody's there
And if you don't know anyone
You'll still meet some new friends
That's the way it is

And without the day

Play it through the air

Many of our world's problems today
Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood?

You've got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this, like this

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, colour the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high that's why

Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, colour the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

I can take away your scars
I can take away your scars

There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature

It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world

This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (Damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this nightmare will end (Marilyn)? Like Monroe, Norma Jean
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope), for some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (Yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah)
I got a contact like eyewear
Woah, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here
20/20 hindsight in my side mirror
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea
Fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault (A salt)
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho, got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID)
You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat)
Infected with SARS and Corona (Infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (Damn)
And it goes from martian to human (Yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (Brr)
It's like trying to fight off a gnat (Fight off a gnat)

What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea

Making love, drunk or stoned

Ends up the same, sweating in the rain

No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out

Rock-roll devil take me tonight
Like a bitch making heat
Beatin' on my chest, licking at my feet

Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, I'm in my bag (My bag)
Get a little teste when I'm mad (I'm mad), sick of wrestling this iPad (iPad)
Unsuccessfully, I might add
And I know it's best to leave it lie
But even I get obsessed with reading everything
And let it get the best of me 'til I snap ('Til I snap)
But I need to get off the internet (Get off the internet)
I need to get on the mic (Get on the mic)
You need to get off the internet (Internet)
You need to get you a life
Why you waste time just to comment on shit? (Comment on shit)
Especially shit you don't like (Shit you don't like)
Don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin' some shit he didn't write (Shit he didn't write)
What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen
He used to rap like the people his music was for
He was exactly like them
The dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?
Can't use that excuse anymore
He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war
With a cloud, he's yellin' at it again
I talked to your mother, she told me she loved me
All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me
Wants nobody but me, she showed me the Dougie
Can I get a witness like notary public? (Preach)
She said, Kick some fly shit (Fly shit)
I said, I got wings on my ass (Wings on my ass)
Told her my dick's a cockpit (Dick's a cockpit)
I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)
Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded
This instru's mental (This instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges
When did it start? I been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten
Mental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'
Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (Meal's gonna come from)
Now, I just wonder (Now I just wonder) where my next mill's gonna come from (Mill's gonna come from)
I cannot have no success (Have no success), unless when I finally make it (Finally make it)
I get to remind all the haters (Remind all the haters) who shitted on me when I'm on my way up (I'm on my way)
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs
I will swear on a stack of Bibles
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, I don't care
It's Music to Be Murdered By, so Bon Iver can swallow a fuckin' Ja Rule bobblehead
And die slow like Alzheimer's (Ha-ha)
Lone sniper, I hold a microphone like a loaded rifle
My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull's fire
All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires
And y'all are flow biters, so I don't gotta
Explain why they call me your ghostwriter

I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had (Illa)

Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, it's in my bag
I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad
But gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest
You're still gonna hit the canvas
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's fittin' to hit the fan
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that
Then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus
To think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then
Pit it against these pitiful rappers
Insidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammer's
Get your whole squad, send a task force in
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then
Put your helmet on, strap your chin
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with
Or to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?
No offense, but are you retards slow or dense?
A fuckin' penny has more sense
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill
And so methodical, thought I swallowed a pill
I'm starting to feel like I'm an automobile
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles
And that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice I made
Swore someday the world would pay less to lose, more to gain, daughters raised
Yesterday, glory days, adored and praised, ignored the hate
Addressed the fake, toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came
Destroyed the game before you came, enjoy your stay
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim that you're gonna point and aim
If it joined a gang, your shit isn't going to bang
You're just boring, lame and more of the same
You have an enormous chain, but a stormless brain
The most you can form is rain
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game
So, bitch, quit lyin', you're denyin' like Mr. Porter's name
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter
Fire mortar (Brr) rounds, Ayatollah, every iota I load up
I owe to my motor mouth
This is my note to self
Sometimes you're gonna bomb
So you just might have to blow yourself up with no one's help
I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes
Preemo, take us out

Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside
Writin' in my book of rhymes
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside

When hope and love has been lost
And you fall to the ground
You must find a way
When the darkness descends
And you're told it's the end
You must find a way
When God decides to look the other way
And a clown takes the throne
We must find a way
Face the firing squad
Against all the odds
You will find a way

Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm trying to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say yeah I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me (back to me)
But still I have to say, I have to say!

I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me

This is the song about your fucking mother

It ain't easy living like a gypsy
Telling you, honey, how it feels
I've been dreaming, floating downstream
And losing touch with all that's real
Whole lot of lover, keeping undercover
Never knowing where you been, oh yeah
You've been fading, always out parading
Keep in touch with mama kin
You always got your tail on the wag
Spitting fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out 'cause someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line

Bald as an egg at eighteen
And working for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no

It ain't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is

No head, no nothing, gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in a cloud, baby
Baby, I got that feeling
Don't know why you do this to me
I try to tell 'em not to do it, it's loud
I try to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap till we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the ride, bus
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless

When you're talkin' to yourself and nobody's home
You can fool yourself, you came in this world alone (Alone)

So nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be?
So what'll happen to you, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's gettin' much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
An' what more could you ask from me, yay?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everythin', said, you took everythin' from me
Hey, yeah

Young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still, talkin' to myself and nobody's home (Alone)

So nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see

When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way, find another day
With all the changin' seasons
Of my life, maybe I'll get it right next time
An' now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds, back down on the ground
An' you don't talk so loud an' you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?

Well, I jumped into the river too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own an' driftin' all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is gettin' closer
An' the waves, they get so high
Seems everythin' we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?

I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time, whoa, this time
Without you
I knew the storm was gettin' closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everythin' we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die

I am going up
I am going all the way through the fire
I get up and go higher

And nothing is gonna bring me down
I am going all the way thru the fire
I will get up and then go higher
So please don’t knock me down
And nothing is gonna knock me down

Now I ain’t got no kids yet,
But this one here is for practice
I hate to get the seats in Benz wet.
But that’s how good your ass is.
Make an old man get his glasses.
Make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow ur moves all weak on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga consider.
You rocking now with the best Mayne. (man)
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag but the boy has been blessed with the blessed mayne
Let you play with the stick ovechkayne.
She’s calling, she’s texting
She’s falling but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend 
Skate girl
Cauz a nigga don’t play them ex games.
No! Straight sexing
No handcuffs or arresting
And I ain’t coming off my last name.
Cauz I really can’t take no stressing
Bout where I done been
Who I done hit
Your home girl saying 
He’s a bad boy
Bout where I done been
Who I done hit
Your home girl saying 
He’s a bad boy

She said
I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good
And every body knows

I can’t get enough of what you got
Good god
You hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not
So don’t you stop I need that

Hey globetrotter,
Cole hotter
Either way
Out in London town
Hoes holla Cauz they love my sound
And I got love for the underground.
Kweli pimp C hot town
Where bun gets down
Met a bad bitch 
That’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night
You just, cut off lights
Never fuss or fight 
Almost missed my flight
Tryna give my last girl a nut
All Right?
She be down for whatever 
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts
All Right?

On the grynd tryna find
This lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Chorus]
I am going up
I am going all the way through the fire
I get up and go higher 
So please don’t bring me down
And nothing is gonna bring me down
I am going all the way thru the fire
I will get up and still get higher
So please don’t knock me down
And nothing is gonna knock me down

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we are dealt
We have to take these cards ourselves
And flip them. Don’t expect no help
Now I could have 
Either just
Sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I am placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the posch hoped and prayed 
For a dad to show who never did
I just wanted to fit in
At every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it means acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making
That face it’ll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I am just standing
There holding
My tongue tryna talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue 
On that
Frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
Cauz I wasn’t tryna impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cauz where you see it from where you are sitting
Its probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes
At least 
What size you wear??
I wear tens
Let’s see if you can fit your feet

[Chorus]
I am going up
I am going all the way through the fire
I get up and go higher 
So please don’t bring me down
And nothing is gonna bring me down
I am going all the way thru the fire
I will get up and then go higher
So please don’t knock me down
And nothing is gonna knock me down

I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
You looked right through me, you were miles away

All my dreams, they fade away
I'll never be the same
If you could see me the way you see yourself
I can't pretend to be someone else

Always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

When no one is around, then I have you here
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
You always have the biggest heart
When we're six thousand miles apart

Too much of no sound
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Those three words are never enough
When it's long distance love

Always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away, so far away, so far away

I'm alright, don't be sorry, but it's true
When I'm gone, you'll realize
That I'm the best thing that happened to you

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away

You always love me more, miles away
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
You're not afraid to tell me miles away

_x000D_
Frankie and me we were lovers
Oh lordy how we could love
Swore we'd be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong

My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled, I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong

Yeah! Frankie came looking to find me
Yes, she wasn't looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was totin' a 44 gun
To shoot her man if he was doin' her wrong

Well Frankie walked into the bar room
And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong

Frankie, I beg, please don't shoot me
Well they'll put you away in a cell
You know they'll put you where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner in hell
I'm your man, I know I done you wrong

Easy on the roll, real easy
Easy on the roll, real slow
Roll me over real gently
'Cause my wound hurts me so
Well I was her man
Well I done her wrong

Well Frankie told Johnny
Well this is the end of my song
I was her man, well I done her wrong
Well , hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Done her wrong

You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you're goddamn right, I am
Look at you, this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally, but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink, My pussy does it stink
He still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he? Still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And there's no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone, is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once
And once she does, she'll be stuffed up in a trunk
Crunchy, scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt, deceitful witch
You thought you had me, till my shrink told me this

The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

I feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and sent up the river
I shiver when I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep?
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together when we slept together everything
Was all better, she made me feel like a king
Slowly she began lowering my self-esteem
She'd go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream and holla
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we'd just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh! She's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, till my shrink told me this

The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

Hey buds below ... up is where to grow
Up with which below can't compare with.
Hurry - it's lovely up here ...
Life down a hole takes an awful toll,
What with not a soul there to share with
Hurry - it's lovely up here!
Wake up, bestir yourself, it's time that you disinter yourself
You've got a spot to fill - a pot to fill
And what a gift package of showers, sun and love
You'll be met above everywhere with,
Fondled and sniffed by millions who drift by,
Life here is rosy - if you're a posy
Hurry it's lovely here!
Climb up geranium, it can't be fun subterran-ium
On the exterior, it's cheerier
RSVP peonies, pollinate the breeze,
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy
Come give at least a preview of Easter
Come up and see the good we're giving
Come up and see the grounds for living
Come poke your head out,
Open up and spread out,
Hurry it's lovely here!

Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need.

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end.
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created.

You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by.

Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own.
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?

If there's a God in the sky looking down,
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London

Yo, I do deals but I never get twanged
Moves that ain't ever been planned
Know goons that were never in gangs
Where I'm from chat shit get banged
Where I'm from chat shit, let the 12-gauge rip
Yeah, sick how it fits in my hand
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam
Or these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef a grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time-keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride, shoot a guy
Leave you wet like you scuba dive
You were younger then, and now we're unified
South London boys get you crucified
I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things
They just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time
Yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the divide tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back in the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London Town, right now

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (woop woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceiling low (ceiling low)
Sweat brow dripping down when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (they don't)
So take me back to London

Yo when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top-ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock 5970 daily
But I want soul
I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowing up my phone
And Ted said, That's just the way things go
It's just the way things go, amazing flows
Grime or rap, man, I give 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow and went global, man
Now the case is closed

2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years you'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
And when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto' (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Jet-plane, headed up to the sky (to the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle night, ceiling low (ceiling low)
Sweat brow dripping down when in Rome (when in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London

I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind.
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Look down angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed your cheek, I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours?
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed it's hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

This is a hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere, and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
If I had a thousand tongues I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today even one may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Cake walking baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me where they belong
I wanna take you on a roller coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
I'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss away the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

I love women, and she loves men
We've been to the west and we're going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

It’s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me
All that’s left is shattered hearts
It’s plain enough for us to see that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me

We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love

Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me

We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love

I lost it in your kiss, your lips,
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer’s touch
It’s true
I’m glad I’m not you

Got your invitation to the dance
Wear your party dress

I never even knew the song
The orchestra was playing

See the cuties in their party clothes
Oh it's getting warm
Off the shoulder cut into the hip
Like a uniform
Did you think I'd want to tow the line?
Well, now the line is broken

Refuse to dance [4x]

You said you're such a pretty thing
You could make a mark
I'll teach you all the steps you'll need
Guide you through the dark
Suddenly I thought I knew the song

Refuse to dance

You say jump. They jump
You say turn. They turn
Look back in sorrow

When will his voice warm the room again?
He isn't you...He isn't you...
Memories may fade in the shadows behind me
But there'll be the dream
That will always remind me - a dream that
I'll be forever comparing him to...

Sweep every cloud from the sky for me

Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison

Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

You're a liability
You're a little much for me
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave

That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me

Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

Couldn't even bring you back

Feel like I'm circling a drain
All I see is the remains
Of an ugly truth
One hundred models I could follow
All the way to hell and back
But they can't replace you

I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold but on the inside I was burning

But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
And I ain't dead yet

But I lost faith a long time ago

I guess we're getting used to losing hope
Guess we're losing hope

Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?

When I'm lying to myself
What an ugly truth
We're no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same
If we make it through
And we can make it through

My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned

I remember back then
Played my cards but you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessing
Wonder if I'll ever get the message

Say my prayers
But I lost faith a long time ago

I guess we're getting used to losing hope
Guess we're losing hope

I don't even wonder why you don't answer

Just rockin' and reelin', we'll get that feelin'

'Cause you're a fine sweet potato
We'll have a ball and that ain't all
Down in the alley, just you and me

The clock is striking a mournful sound
This time of evening my love comes down
That's when I'm missin' your kind of kissin'
Down in the alley, that's where I'll be
Alright, oh

We just get started 'bout half past one

Your lips are so tender,
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender.
Tell me, darling, will it last?

Will you be with me when the moon's bright?

Here I am again
Waiting on the moment you decide
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere
I've been so close to you so many times
I feel like I could drown
I wish that I could fly away from here

But I'm still coming down
From the last time
That you came around
In the starlight
Now I am pulled into your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite (like a lonely satellite)

Walked on Jupiter
Flew around the Moon a time or two
Left a mark on every star we could find
But now I'm burning like a meteor
That never hits the ground
Wish that I could fly away from you

But I'm still coming down
From the last time
That you came around
In the starlight
Now I am pulled into your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
Like a lonely satellite

Love is poisoning the atmosphere
Is keeping everything unclear to me
There's something in your eyes
Never satisfies
I'm feeling so alone, tonight

But I'm still coming down (still coming down)
From the last time (the last time)
That you came around (you came around)
In the starlight (the starlight)
Now I'm pulled into your gravity
Spinning helplessly
I'm falling through the night
(Falling through the night)
Yes, I'm falling through the night

Morning, Marshall.

Morning, doc.

So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?

Ah, anxious.

Anxiety?

Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world. Nervous.

Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now
You're sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this
You found a sponsor yet?

Um, not yet. But I mean, when I get back...

Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't.

Well, yeah, I mean I gotta start going to meetings first and...
Wait, what?

Well, I mean you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
I mean it's not like... a requirement
If they fit into your schedule, I know you're a busy person.

Well, yeah, but I thought sobriety was the most important thing?

So what else are you thinking?

Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps, and
I mean, learn 'em, and start being able to apply 'em.

The steps?

Yeah, the steps.

There's a lot of them, aren't there?

Well, 12, but–

Christ, I don't even know them all.

Really?

Anything else?

Um, well, I mean the only other question I have is, like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that
And I get tempted to—

Take a drink.

What?

Take a drink, and y'know, take the edge off.

Take the edge off? Man, if I have a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to.

What, you mean these?

No, what the fuck?!

Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts, are we? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall
We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall? Marshall!!

Oh no, no, no! Come on, man!
Oh, fuck you, man!

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
I put your picture on that wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
I put your picture on that wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you don't wanna to talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan
P.S.: We should be together too

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
I put your picture on that wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And that story isn't over, but I have to tell the truth
I know I couldn't do a justice, only one who could is you
Because I idolized you, Marshall, and nobody understands
Maybe I'm a little crazy, maybe I'm just like Stan, damn

I ain't here to put a stack up
Cause my main girl is my back up
I ain't here to fall in love
Just tryin' to bust a nut real quick and get back up
I expect to get treated
The same way I'm treating you
Grind all my staff and take all my cash
Spend it all on you
I know how the game goes
Get what you pay for
Got a pocket full of money
Just waiting for you honey
Now go and get your back skirt

Now lil mama are you with' it
I got the keys to the city
I wanna fuck you
And you wanna fuck me
Baby girl admit it
Now lil mama are you with' it
I got the keys to the city
I wanna fuck you
And you wanna fuck me
Baby girl admit it

So let's just do it
Let's just do it
Let's just do it
Let's just do it
So let's just do it
Let's just do it
Let's just do it
Let's just do it

Cause I know you want it
But you only here for my money
It's cool that we make a fair trade
Both leave here happy and we get something from it
Now you could stick around all day
Spend the night til the morning
And if you stay I'll make sure you're straight
I just wanna hear you say it baby girl
Are you coming
So are you with' it

I got the keys to the city
I wanna fuck you
And you wanna fuck me
Baby girl admit it
Now lil mama are you with' it
I got the keys to the city
I wanna fuck you
And you wanna fuck me
Baby girl admit it

Ah lahmlahlah
Ah lahmlahlah

I met this girl late last year
She said, Don't you worry if I disappear.
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, I was never looking for a friend.
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM.
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said.
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah

[2x:]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I'm a give her just that what she said
And I'm a break her down till she can't get it out of her head
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
Throw dat dick, she loves it

She loves the way I put it down on her fine ass
Straight strong armed robbery black mask
The whole 9 and a half in your fat ass
I got the pussy soaking wet just that fast
Said she got it from her mama she a freak too
And she got a couple friends she could bring too
I'm a beat it up, like a bongo
And I've a feeling like she deep off in the Congo
See I'm world wide, with my dick game
Kuntakinte my nick name, ain't shit changed
You know my pedigree, she got up in it like geodesy

I wanna make love, when she whisper in my ear in the club
She now wanna make love

Throw dat dick, she loves it

She got a whole lot of ass and a lil waist
The reason bout to have me guilty on a murder case
She said I tried to kill her pussy first [?] 8
I guess she looking like Rihanna, need a piece of cake
I rode a night I love it on the strip club
So many women to choose from, I'm mixed up
Magic city on Mondays, I'm all in
High next Tuesdays, I'm balling
Wednesdays I'm headed took them all
I love the girls and I'm tryna fuck them all
I'm a stroke current [?]

She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck

It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings I recall 
It's the mistier mist
The hazier days
The brighter sun
And the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't too hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings, to waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle aged years
It's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason for living or dying
When you're young and your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk with endlessly restless feet
Half of the time
We'd broaden our minds
More in the poolhall than we did in the schoolhall
With the downtown chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife, the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a smalltown boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives 
Wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for
breakfast I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Jimi Hendrix, he was good,
William The Conqueror
Now, who else do I like?

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Yo, you might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
(Grrrr, arf arf) Or leaning out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, 'cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (God damnit!)
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screaming, I don't care, just bite me (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves Clowns 'cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(Ah!) Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all running your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus, you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy
My fuckin bitch mom's suing for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter your [attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot!
Talking about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
OK, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
Uh, here – double XL, double XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ah fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me (take shots at me)

Scratch me now a little lower

Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

'Cause you like me too much and I like you

Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aww shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurring
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurring
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurring before, after and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No I'm pushing you out the door
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a hoe
It's pandemonium standing know when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house nigga!
Fuck yo' couch nigga!
You're screaming, Fuck the world! with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neuman mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the fuck you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice wear
It's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here letting the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying
We do it to try to do without trying

The reproach in her eyes is imagined

She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried

You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shaking
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it
And you say, Screw you!
I say, I love you!
And I know it's true

You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (Not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it
But you're close to tears
Oh God! I'm sorry for the wasted years

They say distance is relative
And relative to relatives I have
I'd say I'm relatively close
To breaking down
Because right now
I feel so alone
I've been missing the elements and
Wishing the elephant in the room
Would leave and kindly close the door
I can't ignore
Him like before
Not anymore

Oh I, miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how, it feels at six feet

Space and time are interwoven
Well at least that's what we're told
When I was young I was suspicious but it's true
Time sticks like glue
I feel so blue
Here missing you
So I think I'll build a time machine and go back to a time
When we didn't need to measure six feet on the ground
When I came around
That's not allowed
I can't go back now

So I, miss you most at
Six feet apart when you're
Right outside my window
But can't ride inside my car
And it hurts to know just how lovely you are
And be too far away to hold but close enough to break my heart
I miss your smile
Feels like miles
Six feet apart

So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how, it all feels to me
So far, so far but so close
Like a star, out in the cosmos
Can't touch, the beauty I see
That's how, it feels at six feet

See who will hold you and kiss you good night

You fight 'em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin

Don't leave me now
Now that I need you
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through

Don't break my heart
This heart that loves you
They'll just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now
(Don't leave me now)

What good is dreamin'
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust
Like a book on a shelf

Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now

Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't you leave me now

Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words I guess...

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
Daddy, look what I made, Dad's gotta go catch a plane
Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. Daddy, you're lying.
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine.
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you.
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying, You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding.
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad.
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going.
But, baby, wait.
It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, Die Shady! and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her,
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

All alone she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doing wrong
On the move got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the news

You're living on sunset time

Feeling bad
You're living much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breaking every law

You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

On the go
Got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Living hot, doing what you should not
The break is on me then what do you got
We're living on sunset time

Shoot the breeze
You feel that she's the tease
Your night is free what you wanna be
Who's to trust when living dangerous
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose

You are there when the night's in town
Standing there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema
You think there's nothing wrong

Going town
You do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon
Gotta fever in your shoes
The night's on you
What are you gonna do?

Got to reach that driver

Won't hide who I am

I'm strummin' my guitar
I'm singin' songs about my life
If I could tell the truth
I'd tell you what I meant by
Me, myself, and I

I'm not wearing any make-up
Won't hide who I am
I'll be what I am
I'm just being honest with my self once again
I'm my only friend

No more mirrors
No more vanity
Give it all away for free
Donate to charity
I am happy in my skin
I try, my heart is not the same

You'll always find

I'm not wearing any make-up
Won't hide who I am

The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Number forty-seven said to number three:
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Sad Sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone.

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair.

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.

Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though, oh well
This is my life so as I go and try on clothes for tonight's show
To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird
To this day because all's I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some ol' inspirational shit in a real way
But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit
In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, 'cause I still make fun
Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence
It's a balance beam, if I seem unbalanced, it's challenging
When my conscience allows me to think the most foulest
Childish things without even blinking, without even thinkin' about
All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin'
But the crowds, they're screaming
And The Palace sold out this evening
But now it's lay me down to sleep
And is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap?
Is it greed? And do I take more than I need?
When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

So a martyr is how I paint myself
And through my harrowin' ordeals I'm so vain I want my respect
But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
'Til I sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights
Yeah, it's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a night mirror
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might
Say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears
'Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it
But I like stayin' feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit from
And this house, is quite bare, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, it's nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song
Vicious cycle ain't it, then wonder why I stay famous
I keep walkin' the line, this goldfish bowl gets old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore
If you got the soul of a soldier, or you sold your soul

I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need
I know, it's a fine, fine line
Living in hope or dire need

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin', hate even going outside
It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's
Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time
When I slept on the floor at The Outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I—

I know, it's a fine, fine line

I know, it's a fine, fine line

Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

By a swamp in Alabama in the cold in the damp
Sittin reading by the light of a kerosene lamp
Lives a holly roller with a mission on her mind
Got to spread the word to anybody she can find
You can hear her screaming any time in night or day
This is what she says to keep the demons away

Run devil run, the angels having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

Her brother and her sister said that she brought them down
Steppin on the bus that was heading to town
There they started drinking, they got into a fight
The sheriff introduced them to the jailhouse for a night
When the holy roller came to town to pay the bail
This is what she sang as she was leaving the jail

Run devil run, the angels having fun

Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

Visiting the nieghbours trying to spread the good news
Singing gospel music with a hint of the blues
All of them determined to deliver the goods
Now you you hear the music comin out on the woods

Run devil run, the angel having fun
Making winners out of sinners better leave before it's done
When he gets through, he'll be coming after you,
Listen what I'm saying to you Run . . . Run Devil Run

Ah you'ld better Run . . . Run Devil Run
You better Run . . . Run Devil Run

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life's for my own, to live my own way 
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Life's for my own, to live my own way

You can call me a sinner
You can call me a saint
Celebrate me for who I am
Dislike me for what I ain't
Put me up on a pedestal
Or drag me down in the dirt
Sticks and stones will break my bones
But your names will never hurt

I'll be the garden
You be the snake
All of my fruit is yours to take
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can
Love me or leave me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop
No, no

Cleopatra had her way
Matahari did too
Whether they were good or bad
Is strictly up to you
Life is a paradox and it doesn't make much sense
Can't have the Femme without the Fatale
Please don't take offense

Don't let the fruit rot under the vine
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine
Better the devil that you know
Your love for me will grow
Because

This is who I am
You can
Like it or not
You can

He's three drinks down and he's driving fast
He's calling her up but she took a cab
Back to their one room apartment
Back to where it all started
Walking up to the door way
Walking in just to realize
She was long gone before he got there
Broken glass in the bathroom

Love is such a fragile dance
This love is such a fragile dance

She's wondering if she was right to
Leave before they got that
Chance to talk it all over
In a text message he wrote her

Love is such a fragile dance
Our love is such a fragile dance

And no one knew that they were on the edge
Cause life is short and love is sweet
So love until you're dead
And no one knew that they were on the edge
Cause life is short and love is sweet
So love until you're dead

He's three drinks down and he's driving fast
She's calling him back now he's reaching
Car tires are screeching
Car horns are screaming
He's wondering if he was right to
Pick a fight just to argue
But he can't take it back now
The last message he sent out

Life is such a fragile dance
His life was such a fragile dance
Love is such a fragile dance
Their love was such a fragile dance

And no one knew that they were on the edge
Cause life is short and love is sweet
So love until you're dead
And no one knew that they were on the edge
Cause life is short and love is sweet
So love until you're dead

She's three drinks down and she's crying
No fight is worth fighting
No fight is worth dying
But all love is worth fighting for

And no one knew that they were on the edge
Cause life is short and love is sweet
So love until you're dead
And no one knew that they were on the edge
Cause life is short and love is sweet
So love until you're dead
So love until you're dead
So love until you're dead

The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha, ride

All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die

He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, Take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a G Thang
And a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringin'
I said, It's Dre's day, and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die (Always die)

One I wished I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

And though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

We were bold
We were dust
We were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be
Effortless dancing with symmetry
And the memory's more or less killing me

All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Don't fight it

Change my mind
Make me drown for you again
Take the time
Got you wonderin' where I've been
Are you ever gonna change my mind?
(Are you ever) change my mind
I've been waiting for you, change my mind
(Are you ever) change my mind

Change my name
Chain the words to my dying day
But I just seem to keep pushing you away
And it's all I can do as an optimist
To look out on the shore for our lonely ship

All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Can't fight it

Change my mind
Make me drown for you again
Take the time
Got you wonderin' where I've been
Are you ever gonna change my mind?
(Are you ever) change my mind
I've been waiting for you, change my mind
(Are you ever) change my mind

Change my mind (are you ever)
Make me drown for you again
(Are you ever)
(Are you ever)
(Are you ever)
Change my mind (are you ever)
Make me drown for you again
Are you ever?
Are you ever?

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

When a father's love is doin' you wrong
When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah
But if I'm bein' selfish, that gave me a reason to be there
With my flannel on

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

You see, I've been down that road before
And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy
With nothin' to lean on (nothin' to lean on)
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I was a stan
I was leavin' with my flannel on

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
The character's in the way you wear it
It takes your shape while you keep it on
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

Now I pledge you'll never ever be alone again
And I pledge these arms and chest are here to hold you in from the cold

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
Ooh, here's my flannel
The character's in the way you wear it (the way you wear it)
It takes your shape while you keep it on (all you gotta do is keep it on)
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
And may we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

(Do you see?
Look at all of it from up here
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
Do you see it?
It's in the air
It's in your blood
It's in your skin
Can you see it from up here?
Can you taste it?
Can you touch it?
It's in the earth
It's in the sky
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?)

Far away from the crowd
All alone upon the beach
Our lips and our arms
Close within each other's reach
Will be on a moonlight swim

Let's go on a moonlight swim
To the raft we can race
After just a little while
I'll sit and pretend
That you're on a desert isle
With me on a moonlight swim

Though the air is cold
With kisses oh so sweet
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from head to you feet

Let's go on a moonlight swim
We're in love and above
There's a crazy gold balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to come on in
On a moonlight swim

With a good luck charm like you

Come on and be my little good luck charm

I want a good luck charm
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

Don't want a silver dollar
Rabbit's foot on a string
The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring

Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm
a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say

Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm

To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
It's been nearly an hour since I thought of you

But you're not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least by that, I'd know that you're okay
A guy like you ain't meant to go away, no

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done?
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame

I'm tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
A couple more 'til I forget your name

I saw a guy that looked like you
I did not know quite what to do
It took a power of will to break my stare
I realize what I wanted wasn't there

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done?
Looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess we're like water and a flame
Water and a flame

And if you see me coming
Look away, look away
And if your mind is made up
Look away, look away

And if you're worried about me
I'm okay, I'm okay!
Yes, I am!
Oooooo
Ohhhh

Now you're gone
There's nothing else I want
Now that it's over
There's nothing else I want
What have I done?
Looks like I was wrong

She was always in a hurry
Never took the time to look around
She was always one to worry and fret
Staring at the ground
Every minute she'd be rushing
Someone always breathing down her neck
Felt like everyone was pushing her down
Keeping her in check

How could she leave?
She's gotta stay
Somebody has to sit and wait
Deep in a dream
She hears a voice
It's not too late to celebrate

Uncontrollable laughter
(Not too late to celebrate)
Round and round in her head
(No one said you've got to wait)
This is what she was after
(Not too late to celebrate)
Not too late, not too late

It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you've gotta wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby, yeah-yeah
It's never too late to celebrate
And no one said you had to wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

Now she doesn't have to hurry
She can do exactly what she wants
Ask her why she doesn't worry or fret
This is her response

Uncontrollable laughter
Round and round in her head
This is what she was after
Not too late, not too late

It's never too late to celebrate
No one said you've gotta wait
Allow me to congratulate you, baby, yeah-yeah
It's never too late to celebrate
Allow me to congratulate
It's never too late to celebrate you, baby

Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late to celebrate
Never too late, never too late

I'll wait for a sign

As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut
Or free your mind
Or stay hypnotized

When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for the sign

Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up
And loaded on my back
And it weighs me down

When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

I am waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign, yeah

Whole life ahead of her
Slashed her wrists
Bored with life
Didn't succeed
Thank the lord
For small mercies

Fighting back the tears
Mother reads the note again
16 candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame
It's always the same
She goes down on her knees
And prays

I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humour
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing

Girl of 18
Fell in love with everything
Found new life
In Jesus Christ
Hit by a car
Ended up
On a life support machine

Summer's day
As she passed away
Birds were singing
In the summer sky
Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye

Of Susan when she tried

No there's never been a woman
Who could make me weak inside
And give me what I needed
Like Susan when she tried

It gets worse in the summer
When the nights are hot and long
And it's bad in December
When they play those Christmas songs
So if you ask me and I don't tell you
Bet your sweet bottom dollar I lied
'Cause there's never been one better

Uh, first verse, uh
I'm armed/on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt I kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s!
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily!

[Eminem:]
Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpin' Ice, Ice Baby screaming, Shady 'til I die!
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, came to drive them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark,
maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'mma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'mma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'mma live this

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now

I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
Livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

[Royce Da 5'9:]
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle, as Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian
Go back and forth in more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, chimney now; the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—

[Eminem:]
Now, was called M&M, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all,
He shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9″ to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, she tryna d-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick suckin' lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

[Royce:]
And then after takin' that, I'mma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say The whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo!)
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up data
Rolling over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, they're sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

[Eminem:]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're...

You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much

I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger, no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines

I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

I must be strong so she won't know
How much I miss her
I only hope as time
Goes on, I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love
Love, love, love her

Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you, baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard, to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?

Ooh, I need your loving tonight
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving, baby, tonight
(Hit me)

Ooh, I need your loving tonight

No, I'll never, look back in anger
No, I'll never, find me an answer
Gave me no warning, how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving tonight

A truth and pain but through it all
You will always have my heart

And no one will ever hear a sound
Oh, only you can hush it
And calm the turmoil and the noise
And help me reach the higher ground

There's nothing we can't get through

Maybe I should say my last goodbyes
It could be for the last time
And it's not right
Don't let yourself get in over your head, he said
Alone and far from home, I'll find you

Dead, like a candle you burned out
Spill the wax over the spaces
Left in place of angry words
Scream to be heard
Like you needed any more attention
Throw the bottle, break the door, and disappear

Sing me to sleep
I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say
I miss you. I'm so sorry.

Forevers never seemed so long
As when you're not around
It's like a piece of me is missing
I could have learned so much from you
But what's left now?

Don't you realize you showed this family a world of pain?
Can't you see this could have been
The happy ending we let go?

Sing me to sleep
I'll see you in my dreams
Waiting to say
I miss you.

Crash diet of reds'n'ludes
A shot of vitamin C and a bottle of booze
Too stupid to live with nothin' to lose
In your one track mind now
Where's that leave you?

Drink'n'drive white lightning faster baby
Takin' your last ride
Now better be so careful or you'll be dead before you time
Sorry you took mother's car now

Tears in my eyes, baby please don't go
You've had one too many, havin' one for the road
Fresh from detox, fresh from jail
Took your rehabilitation and you drove me to hell

Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Sorry you took mother's car now

Too soon, you thought you didn't mean it
Too late for the pressure and strain
Too bad for those who don't believe it
Ruby street still calls your name

Itchy trigger finger and the race to be alive
Smokin' a cig while you drink'n'drive
With no control of your life ahead
You're never going to see it if you wind up dead

Drink'n'drive white lightning faster
Takin' your last ride
Better be so careful or you'll be dead before your time
Drink'n'drive white lightning baby
It's always on your mind
Push it to the limit baby, do it one more time
Break it down
Break it down
Somethin's changin', somethin's breakin'
You gotta be a brother, of your family
Maybe one more time will make it
Sweet history, oohh
If you don't care about yourself
Would you please leave me alive
Ooohh
You gonna
You gonna drink'n'drive

_x000D_
Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it's probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)

So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, Oops and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, Fuck you, punk and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
Ding-dong, the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', Bye-bye stepdad (Stepdad)

I'm on the right track for lots of kissin'
So that old greenback, I won't be missin'
All the greatest things in life are free
Who needs money, not me

Cash or credit, it doesn't matter
Long as my bank books keep growin' fatter
Easy street is my favorite avenue
Who needs money, I do

Just pity all those millionaires they never can relax
Because they're always worryin' about their income tax
Why waste time on high financin', I'd rather spend it on good romancin'
What if my pockets are empty as can be
Who needs money, not me
Tell me about it

Some folks save it, some folks lend it
But as for me I want to spend it
Give me some green and my skies will be blue
Who needs money, I do

Stocks and bonds, they only bore me
Interest holds no interest for me
Who wants to sit in the lap of luxury
Who needs money, not me

When I go to bed at night instead of counting sheep
I start counting dollar bills and then I fall asleep

Making money never thrills me
It's making love that really kills me
What can I lose with my philosophy
Who needs money, not me

What do you want

I want a big yacht, I can cruise in
The kind that girls just can't refuse in
All it takes is a million or two
Who needs money, I do

Any time some gal starts flirtin'
Now that I'm broke I know for certain
She really digs my personality
Tell me, who needs money not me

Poverty's the only thing that money cannot buy
So rich or poor it pays to have M-O-N-E-Y

A gal who's tender, that's what I love

It's legal tender, I want a pile of
Just let my liquid assets overflow

You can't take it with you when you go
So, who needs money

That lovely, lovely money

Who needs money, not me

Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on

I climb the stairs up to my room
But no-one greets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on

These walls will hide me when I cry
I hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope has gone
Just call me lonesome from now on

Just call me lonesome from now on

Gettin' bombed out on booze
Got nothing to lose
Run out of money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels
Like living in hell
The girl's on the hustle
With nothing to sell

Want something for nothing
It's always the same
Keep pushin' and shovin'
And I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Well, spread out the news
There's a free man loose
Back out of jail
And chasing some flooze
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Laid out a claim
For monetary gains

Wantin' what's coming
All for the take
Freedom for lovin'
And lust for a taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck, yeah, yeah!

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Broken the chains of bad luck
Bye, bye, bye, bad luck
Throw down the gates of bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance
To bad luck

I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there

I lost the one girl

My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly Lothario

Hay que olvidar

Solo tú, sola yo (ah-ha)

I am a critic
Of my own critical need to define myself
With wine, and words, and lovers
And friends who don't understand

So there, I just said it
You know that admitting the problem is the first step
Towards repair, We all recover
Say the friends turned to wine-drunk lovers

Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye
You are so misleading
A kiss or a gun fight
High-noon or midnight
Darling, I don't want to know
If I'm just a short sight on a cold night
The canals are freezing
So tell me I'm alright with a goodbye

Am I a villain?
Cast among heroes with all of their
Underwhelming overbearing struggles
To become what they'll never be?

Friends to the wicked
Caution is calling, but nobody's home
The lights are off, the party's over
Now you're stuck plucking three-leaf clovers

Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye
You are so misleading
A kiss or a gun fight
High-noon or midnight
Darling, I don't want to know
If I'm just a short sight on a cold night
The canals are freezing
So tell me I'm alright with a goodbye

You've got the high ground
And I'm on my best defense
But I
Dare you to come down
I'll give you an eye for an eye
If it makes things easy

Smile, tell me I'm alright
With a goodbye
You are so misleading
A kiss or a gun fight
High-noon or midnight
Darling, I don't want to know
If I'm just a short sight on a cold night
The canals are freezing
So tell me I'm alright with a goodbye

Smile, tell me I'm alright

There ain't a dream that don't have a chance to come true now

They can't stop us
Because love is on our side, baby
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky
Just believe it, believe in you and I, baby

If we got love that is strong enough
We can do anything
We can through anything
'Cause through it all love will always find a way

Ears twitch, like a dog,
Breaking eggs in a dish.
Do not mock me when I say
This is not a lie.

It's funny thing, half serious,
With our hands on our ears.
Living dreams with mouths ajar,
Wide awake, we go to sleep.

However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.

Something special between us,
When we made love the game was over.
I couldn't say the words,
Words wouldn't get my feelings through,
So I keep talking to you...

However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem.

Custom made dinosaurs,
Too late now, for a change.
Everything is under the sun,
But nothing is for keeps...

Said you loved me

Drunk lust is blind, love, can't choose your type

Had a good time, you can't hold a good time

Still ringing out and echoing around

Oh, willow weep for me
Weeping willow tree
Bend your branches green
Along the stream
That runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me

Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here 
To weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind
And say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a breakin' and a makin' a moan
Murmur to the night
To hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing here and crying all alone
Oh, weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground
And cover me
When the shadows fall
Bend, oh, willow and weep for me

Oh, weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down
Along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall
Bend, oh, willow and weep for me
Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer's dream

May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the light surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young.

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
And may your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young.

They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row.

Cinderella, she seems so easy
It takes one to know one, she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning,
You belong to Me I Believe.
And someone says, You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave.
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row.

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row.

Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row.

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
NOW, he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row.

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They ARE trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
Have Mercy on His Soul
They all play on the penny whistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough

From Desolation Row.
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon-feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
Get outta here if you don't know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row.

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row.

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
Which side are you on?
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row.

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the door knob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Or was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row.

You know what I need
When my heart bleeds
I suffer from greed
A longing to feed
On the mercy in you

I can't conceal
The way I'm healed
The pleasure I feel
When I have to deal
With the mercy in you

I would do it all again
Lose my way and fall again
Just so I could call again
On the mercy in you

When here in my mind
I feel inclined
To wrongly treat you unkind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you

I would lose my way again
Be led hopelessly astray again
Just so I could pray again
For the mercy in you

When here in my mind
I have been blind
Emotionally behind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you

These bitches so cranky, get 'em a hanky
M-mommy, I'm cold, gimme my blankie
Flyer than a kite, I get higher than Rapunzel
Keep the Snow White, I could buy it by the bundle
Step your cookies up 'fore they crumble
Don't be actin' like the Cardinals and gon' fumble
'Cause I'm a Steeler, fresh up out the dealer
All the dope boys gon' feel her
Flow so sick I need a healer
Fuck is my MAC concealer?
I be out in Queens on the back of four-
Whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-wheelers, I'm a big deal
That's why I get more head than a pigtail
Put some ranch out, I'm gettin' the munchies
I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entrée
'Cause they be thinking they can spit, spit-shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch, let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin', like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin', like a can of brew
Listen, you should buy a sixteen, 'cause I write it good
That 808 woof-woof, 'cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man, 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf, where is Little Red-a Riding Hood?

Now, if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, Park it
I don't fuck with pigs, like as-salamu alaykum
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em
And if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, Park it

Wow
It's like I just single-handedly annihilated, you know, every rap bitch in the building
Like, like, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Boss, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie
Like, I mean, I don't even know why you girls bother at this point
Like, give it up! It's me!
I win! You lose hahahahahahaha
Oh, shit! Hahaha, yo

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch

Hahahahahaha
I told you, I told you before
I told you y'all was gonna have to pick my fruit out
Now listen, in addition to pickin' my fruit out
I want y'all to start going to the boutiques
Know what I'm saying?
Get some, get some, get some crazy shit for me
I want, I want, you know, leopard-skin, and, you know?
I want, I want all that crazy lizard-skin shit, like, you know?
Make sure you
You can be my personal shopper!

I can't find a reason to let go 
Even though you've found a new love 
And she's what your dreams are made of 
I can find a reason to hang on 
What went wrong can be forgiven 
Without you it ain't worth livin' alone 

Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine 

I took out all the pictures of our wedding day 
It was a time of love and laughter 
Happy ever after 
But even those old pictures have begun to fade 
Please tell me she's not real 
And that you're really coming home to stay 

Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine 

I can give you two good reasons 
To show you love's not blind 
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you 
So how can I tell them you've changed your mind 

Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine 
I remember when you were mine

Yeah, can't stop now

This may be the last chance I get to be famous
(I just wanna be famous)

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post-office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around
When his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm the thumb tack
That you slept on, son
Now here I come screaming Attack!
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out growed 'em
He's so out cold he's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
To try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers
You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in PF Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down?
You must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whacko 'fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster
To make a cast, beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're Meni Mes
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class
He slugs, you're BBs, you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it; you were dissin' his CDs
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E
He's almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panelling
And cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
He ain't given 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
When it scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out, Awww!
His metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous

Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it
And look what it's done so far

What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic!

Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection

The lovers
The lovers
The dreamers
The dreamers
And me

No one comes near

Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

Wrap me up like a present and put me away

Let the bells ring on a fool's holiday
I swear that I'm more than just broken promises,
decorations can change like tinsel and ribbon so
Do not open 'til you've got forever to spend

I've always lived too selfishly,
nobody's perfect babe
but I never tried to be
So every second I've poisoned and all of the minutes you spent on me
I'd give my whole life's worth of hours to fix what I've broken in the first place

For years and years I pushed you aside
but never again so

Wrap me up like a present and put me away,

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Okay, let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

They see that low rider go by, they're like, Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, Sick 'em, Dre!
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?

And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, Move, a bitch move

Running through my head secretly
The shouts of the boys in the factory
I ring you on the telephone silently
Like blood, like the wine in the darkroom scene

The darkroom scene
Darkroom scene

A letter
Once composed
Seven years long and as tall as a tree
Reading
On the wall
Emissions, efficiency

Efficiency
Efficiency

Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion

Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion
Vision
Of a picture
Like the city
And the air we breathe

The air we breathe
Air we breathe

She stood beside me once again
I knew her face
We met before in the street
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet

The dancing feet, dancing feet

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now) And now my life has changed (My life has changed) in oh so many ways
(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But) But ev'ry now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure

If I had to break it down, I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Moving the furniture when my back is turned
A flick of the lights and the world falls away
And your office job, and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed for all these years

I thought I was a genius
But now I'm twenty two
And it's starting to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds, like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully falling apart for the princess of Norway

But you with your doll's lashes, your infinite T-shirts
I should've known when your favourite record was the same as my father's you'd take me down

I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

You felled me clean as a pine
The man with the axe
And the light in his eyes

We've been through so many hard times, I'm writing a love song
For you, baby

Love soft as an easy chair
Love fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will
make each night the first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and midnight sun
Time... we've learned to sail above
Time... won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen...

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (you remind me)

Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you, no no

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures

See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell.
Call yourself a singer-writer. You're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me,

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice

Long-nighter, short height, and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

'Cause people think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow

From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces

I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache

I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos

I'm always doing shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me,

Still got a rucksack for the old clothes,
I rap with the cold flows,
I'm back with the old jokes,
In fact you don't know,
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant,
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate,

Man, flows developing,
Skin lacks the melanin,
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in,
I do it for the hell of it,
'Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team,
I seem to sell a bit,

I took what held me back with the women,
And then I packaged the image,
Put in some content,
And then I sold it back as a gimmick,
The fact is this,
I'll end up dating actresses,
Wake up on dirty mattresses,
I think I need to practice this,

But I make shit happen, call me a laxative,
World's on my shoulders,
I don't even know what Atlas is,
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is,
I'm back to rapping back to back
'Cause I've been practicing,
I'm back to sing this

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

Another night, another party
Sayin' Hi to everybody
I'm sorry
It's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now
I'm starving

Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I'm not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love
And all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much

I can't fake another smile

And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Ooh, ah (Ooh, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin' on the TV
It's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it's shocking
Don't blame me

I know it's the life that I chose
But, baby, I'm grateful. I want you to know
I'm happy for the love

I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

Omen, omen

You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before my eyes
Then it hit me, you're relocating
And I need you by my side

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

Sipping cherry cola
Staring at the poster on the wall
What's the point of going out
When you could just give me a call?
Sitting on your sofa
Reminiscing over 23
You touched yourself, the way I used to
Now that's just a memory

Weekend wonderful
Fade-away youth
Summer symphony
What could I do?

We were getaway green
In a world of black and white
Getaway green
Like the Costa Mesa traffic lights
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Telling me I'm what you need
Like getaway green
Getaway green

I know I'm not supposed to
Color in the lines when it comes to you
Undefined and out of mind
'Til you get lost and lonely, too
I guess I get the message
We don't have to stress this anymore
If it happens, then it happens
Happy to have you at all

Weekend wonderful
Fade-away youth
Summer symphony
What could I do?

We were getaway green
In a world of black and white
Getaway green
Like the Costa Mesa traffic lights
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Telling me I'm what you need
Like getaway green
Getaway green

Do you want to know how the story ends?
Hazy and spun out, just more than friends
Weekend wonderful, a dizzy dream
A colorful lie, we made a hell of a team

We were getaway green
In a world of black and white
Getaway green
Like the Costa Mesa traffic lights
Keep on, keep on, keep on
Telling me I'm what you need
Like getaway green

You know what it takes,
You've got it, baby.
You are the only one I chose.
Don't leave me here with all these heartaches,
Only you and heaven knows
About my troubles troubles troubles.

When it rains, it really pours...

You shouldn't have took away my loving
You know you thrill me from head to toe.
I got a feeling for you baby
And you're the only one who knows
About my troubles, troubles, troubles.

When it rains, it really pours...

You know what you did to make me love you
You really opened up my nose.
You got what you wanted, now you left me.
That's the way the story goes.
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles.

Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
Remix
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
What?

[Jermaine Dupri:]
You saw me and the U
In a drop-top Benz, baby, what would you do?
Say it all depends — no, it don't
What you want, that's all it's about
You could say What's up? and keep steppin'
Or cut and turn us both out
See, all I'm tryna do is make you party right
Non-stop tricks by the flock, Cubans with the rocks
Superior yachts, the spot that stay hot (Hot)
To hell with your block, I got the radio on lock, what

[Usher, Jermaine Dupri:]
Before anything came between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems (That's right)
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how you make me wanna

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
This is what you do
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
This is what you do
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me

[Usher:]
Now what's bad
Is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I
Tell my baby bye-bye
Should I
Do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I
I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Usher, Jermaine Dupri:]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
This is what you do (Say what you do)
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me (You make me)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh baby)
Start a new relationship with you

This is what you do (This is what you do)
(Get 'em up, get 'em up)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me
You make me

At this point (Say what?)
The situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go
(Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it
Why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, you make me wanna)
(Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up)
(You make me wanna)
Oh, oh, you make, make, make me (You make me wanna)
Ooh, oh baby (You make me wanna)
Oh baby, do your thing

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah, come along with it
You're making me, you're making me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you

I wish that it would change, but it won't

You need so much, but not from me
Turn your back in my hour of need
Something's wrong, but you pretend you don't see
I think I interrupt your life
When you laugh, it cuts me just like a knife
I'm not your friend, I'm just your little wife

She cannot stay here anymore

The bruises they will fade away
You hit so hard with the things you say
I will not stay to watch your hate as it grows
You're not in love with someone else
You don't even love yourself
Still I wish you'd ask me not to go

He starts to scream, the vases fly

He's not in love with her anymore

You're not in love with someone else

But she'll come back, she knows it then
A chance to start it all again

To live your life the way you want to be
Will you give, If we cry
Will we live or will we die

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that wants to give

Tainted hearts healed with time
Shoot that love so we can stop to the end
Will you give if we cry
Will we live or will we die

I want to tell the people of Argentina
I've decided I should decline
All the honors and titles you've pressed me to take
For I'm contented
Let me simply go on as the woman who brings her people
To the heart of Peron

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina, and always will be

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too

I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul

You're sleeping son, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late
For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

I know it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
Taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
Sleep on, you haven't heard a word

Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through the hell
Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short

'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

Deliciosa

Su pasión está escondida
Nunca sabes lo que va a decir
Cuando empieza a sonreír

Quieres ver lo que siente la mujer
Quieres ver y tratar de comprender la mujer

Seductora, pero nunca fácil, baby
Misteriosamente dura y frágil
Lágrimas que no te enseña
Su dolor no deja huella
No la trates ya de impresionar
Solo déjate llevar

The moon was bright oh how so bright
It was it really was such a night

I had to fall in love

Oh it was a kiss oo-oo what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
Oh how she could kiss oh what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips
Sets me afire
I reminisce and I'm filled with desire
But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember

Oh, what a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget the kiss
The kiss in the moonlight
Oo-oo such a kiss, such a night

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone 
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast down with his ship
Fading in the shadows now

A castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me not
Forgive me, forgive me
Why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost

So how can I blame you

About 5:01
Like my blue ripped jeans

And my eyes are closed
And I'm way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire

On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula One
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you

On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again
And we're still so high

Happy in my second life, headset on
I could be anything, let me be your Midas king
Think of all the joy I'd bring, touching everything

I've been tryna catch a fever dream
In the desert, give me deep blue sea
We ain't nothing, but the things we've seen
Plug me in

So give me the future, it's golden and bright
Catch a fever dream in the flash of the lights
Now nothing is certain, and the song isn't done
But new melodies rise up with the sun
Give me the future

Suddenly found my feet, dreaming of electric sheep
Just a little space to breathe, feeling joy serene

I've been tryna catch a fever dream
In the desert give me deep blue sea
We ain't nothing, but the things we've seen
Plug me in

So give me the future, it's golden and bright
Catch a fever dream in the flash of the lights
Now nothing is certain, and the song isn't done
But new melodies rise up with the sun

I tasted endless love that takes control
Endless love and I wanted more
(So give me the future)
I tasted endless love that takes control
Endless love and I wanted more
(Just give me the future)

Why would we leave, why would we leave?
Miles and miles of fake beauty
It's good for you, it's good for me
Why would we leave, why would we leave?

So give me the future, it's golden and bright
Catch a fever dream in the flash of the lights

When I move a certain way
I feel an ache I'd kept at bay
A hairline break that's taking hold
A metal that I thought was gold

And pure, so sure, I'd struck a vein
I wanted you to feel the same
So when you did ignite a spark
Rescue me from all this dark
See our hearts are intertwined
Then I'm free, free of mind
I'm falling free

And see our hearts are intertwined
And then I'm free, I'm free of mine
And deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind

When I raise a certain wing
And crawl beneath that growing thing
It throws a shadow over time
And keeps yours falling next to mine

Your days were meant to fly and do
I fall and fold mine into you
And what you take is just enough
And what you give is what I love
And when you lift, you raise the sail
And then I'm free, free to fail
I'm falling free

Deep and pure, our hearts align
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

When I lose a certain claim
That tries to know and needs to blame
Whatever river runs aground
It turns my head and washes down

The face of God that stands above
Pouring over hope and love
That all of might, and life, and limb
Could turn around and love again
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, free to go
I'm falling free

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling free

Deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind
When I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go
Deep and pure, our hearts aligned
And then I'm free, I'm free of mind
I let loose the need to know
Then we're both free, we're free to go

I'm not afraid of anything
I just need to know that I can breathe
And I don't need much of anything
But suddenly, suddenly

I am small and the world is big
All around me is fast moving
Surrounded by so many things
Suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

I'm young, and I am free
But I get tired, and I get weak
I get lost, and I can't sleep
But suddenly, suddenly

How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel to be different from me?
Are we the same?
How does it feel?

Would you comfort me
Would you cry with me

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I am small and the world is big
But I'm not afraid of anything

How does it feel to be different from me?

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars, baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Then we keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

To take temporary and think that it's forever

No wonder she suits him,
She never disputes him.
The conversation's not too exciting
But oh,  what a change it must be!
To spend an evening where there's
'No conversation must be a relief after me
And though there's nothing much
To challenge your mind here,
Who cares when the food's so delicious
'Not to mention these beautiful dishes-
A matched set- from France yet
No wonder he loves her,
No wonder to me
With ribbons and laces
In all the right places,
I must admit it's all very pleasant
And this is a comfortable room
And if he likes the smell of lilacs and roses
Then maybe he likes her perfume
And though her silky hair
And milky complexion are nice
Still they're not that distracting
So what accounts for the way he's been acting?
Her softness?
Her sweetness?
How could he resist her
And why would he try?
No wonder he wants her,
He needs her,
He loves her,
No wonder...
So would I!

Babe, I'd do it all over you
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years
Babe, I'd even do that too

A cat, she's got nine lives

I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again
And babe, I'll do it all over you

Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today
Babe, I'd run circles all around
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin
I'd even dance a jig on the ground
Well, everybody gets their hour
Everybody gets their time

Even Sampson after he went blind
Well, everybody gets the chance
To do what they want to do
When my time arrives you better run for your life
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you

Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny
Baby, and my days are gonna come
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant
When you hear me yellin', “Fee-fi-fo-fum”
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
You made me to a walkin' wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady
A-doin' what I want to do
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you

I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late
And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up
After all my liquor's been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been thunk
Well, after I do some of these things
I'm gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you

Run into the alleyways
Steal a little kiss again

You're my only weakness
But somehow you make me strong
After chasin' ghosts and fairytales
I'm right where I belong

And I don't know where I've been lookin'
And I don't care where you have been before

Thankful to feel clear
Thankful my prayers have been answered
I'm Thankful you listened
Thankful to heaven
Thankful for feelin' alive again
Thankful that hearts always mend
I write it all on paper dolls
Let them play their little games
Of who loves who and what is true
No one ever takes the blame

I see you through the window
And it takes my breath away
And I lose the floor beneath me
And all that's left to say is

I don't know where I was goin'
And I don't care where we have been before

To smother my worried brow
Oh the girl I use to be

Feeling fine and full of bliss
What I really wanna say is this
I never has seen snow
All the same I know
Snow ain't so beautiful
Can't be so beautiful
Like my love is
Like my love is
Nothing do compare
Nothing any where with my love
A hundred things I see
A twilight sky that tree
But none so beautiful
Not one so beautiful
Like my love is
Like my love is
Once you see his face
None can take the place of my love
A stone rolled of my heart
When I laid my eyes on that
Near of me boy with that far away look
And right from the start I saw a new horizon
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took
Needed to be took
Needed to be took
Oh!
I never have seen snow
All the same I know
Nothing will ever be
Nothing can ever be
Beautiful as my love is
Like my love is to me
Nothing is as beautiful

We met after dark and after hours
Your lips were cherry sour
We didn't have to speak
We were breakin' out and startin' over
With nothing to control us
Our futures at our feet

But nothing gold can stay, you told me so
Sometimes moving on means letting go
(Stuck in a)

Sad summer daze, don't fade away
Don't fade away from me, no
Sad summer daze, don't fade away
Don't fade away from me, no

Circling your block for half an hour
You said they cut your power
Now it's too hard to sleep
Serendipity and summer showers
We soak it up like flowers
Growing through the concrete

But nothing gold can stay, you told me so
Now all the nights seem just a little darker
Sometimes moving on means letting go
And letting go is only getting harder
(Lost in a)

Sad summer daze, don't fade away
Don't fade away from me, no
Sad summer daze, don't fade away
Don't fade away from me, no

Wasn't our, wasn't our time
Never know, if you don't try
Wasn't our, wasn't our time

Never have to wonder (Wasn't our, wasn't our time)

To keep her from the howlin' winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all

And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the words keep turning down
When things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
We are forever, … keep on, we are forever, … keep on, have to be strong
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
I am forever, I am forever.

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[John Legend:]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, I'm missing you like crazy

[Sam Smith & John Legend:]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, to you?
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Sam Smith & John Legend:]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou

When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart
(oh, let me give my heart)

And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
(I feel that way too)
Is when I fall in love (I fall in love) with you

When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
(oh, I'll never never fall in love)

Just memorizing lines upon your face
I made a map, every photo and the details on the frames
And just last night we spilled red wine, how it stained the floor
And though I know that nothing ever really stays the same, no

Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock
Never let 'em tick, tick, tick
Wherever I go, yeah, I would still know
Even though it's selfish

I don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else
I can't compare you to no one else, no one else
'Cause people change and memories fade
But could you stay the same, if nothing else?
No, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else

Torn by the way your voice is changing on the phone
All this space in between us makes it hard to feel close to you (Close to you)
And just last night I had some red wine and it brought me back
No matter what I'll remember you forever like that, you know (Like that, you know)

Oh, if I could stop the hands of that clock

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you

You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you

If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me

I want that love of yours, to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you

You can sleep in my arms, you don't have to explain
When your heart's crying out, baby, whisper my name
'Cause I've reached out for you when the thunder is crashing up above
You've given me your love
When your smile like the sun that shines through the pain
That's why I'll be there

When the storm rises up, when the shadows descend
Ev'ry beat of my heart, ev'ry day without end
I will stand like a rock, I will bend till I break
Till there's no more to give, if that's what it takes
I will risk everything, I will fight, I will bleed
I will lay down my life, if that's what you need
Ev'ry second I live, that's the promise I make
Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes

Through the wind and the rain, through the smoke and the fire
When the fear rises up, when the wave's ever higher
I will lay down my heart, my body, my soul
I will hold on all night and never let go

Baby, that's what I'll give, if that's what it takes

If that's what it takes

I never knew.
Isn't it a pity
We never met before?
Here we are at last.
It's like a dream.
The two of us
A perfect team.
Isn't it a pity
We never met before?

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted.
Me with the neighbors.
You at silly labors.
What joys untasted.
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer

Let's forget the past.
Let's both agree
That I'm for you
And you're for me.
And it's such a pity
We never, never met before.

Imagine all the years we've wasted.
Fishing for salmon
Losing at backgammon.
What joys untasted.
Me at the Prado,
You in Colorado.

Happiest of girls I'm sure to be
If only you would say to me
That it's such a pity
We never met before.
What an awful pity
We never, never met before.

Because my duty
Was always to beauty
And that was my crime

Feel elation
High
To know I can trust this
Fix of injustice
Time after time

If you see purity
As immaturity
Well it's no surprise
If for kindness
You substitute blindness
Please open your eyes

What did you say?
Oh, I can't hear you
I have an ear infucktion and I cunt finger it out (Out), yeah (I need autotune)

It's my alter ego's fault
These evil thoughts can be so dark
Cerebral palsy, three Zolofts
I eat, doze off to Rico Suave (Look it up)
Cadillac with a ladder rack in the back, with a cracked axel, a backpack full of Paxil
A black satchel, a knapsack and a flask full of 'gnac and Jack Daniels
Girl, let's go back, back to my castle (Yeah)
I don't wanna hassle you, Alexandra
But my dick's an acronym 'cause it stands for you (Stands for you, oh)
Wait, Alexandra who? (Damn)
All I know is Friday, I met you (What?)
Saturday, I'll probably forget you
Guess that's what the Molly and X do (What the fuck?)
'Cause who the fuck am I laying next to? (Huh)
But ever since D-Nice To Tha Rescue, Fila Fresh Crew (Uh)
I been a lab rat (Yeah) from a test tube (Uh)
I'm goin' in like the red roof (Red Roof Inn)
You don't like it, eat a cock 'til your jaw breaks (Yeah)
Call it caught between a rock and a hard place
Like a sasquatch in a crawlspace
'Cause you're watchin' your heart race like you're Scarface
In a car chase with the cops or an arcade
Stuck inside of a Mario Kart race duckin' saw blades
At a stop and a start pace
What I'm tryin' to say is I'm drivin' 'em all crazy

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)
'Cause they won't stop until they cancel me (Yeah, yeah)

I see the rap game, then attack the verses (Uh)
Turn into a graveyard packed with hearses (Yeah)
Just like your funeral, I'm at your service (What?)
Pockets on stuffed like a taxidermist (Woo)
Just landed in Los Angeles when this chick Angela and her grandmother in a tan
Colored van pull up with a hand full of Xans
And a substantial amount of gan' just to ask what my
Grand plans for the night are (Yeah)
I said, Sneak into the Sleep Inn for the weekend and pretend it's a five-star, yeah
I leap into the deep end of the pool
I can show you where the dives are (Get it?), ha
We don't even gotta drive far
I know this spot that is so live
But I'm tryna get some head first (What?), like a nosedive (Haha)
So many side chicks, can't decide which to slide with and which should I ditch
So when it comes to ass, bitch, I get behind like the Heimlich (Get behind, yeah)
Had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin' sides shit
Pushed her out, the side kick, then I flipped the lil' white bitch off like a light switch (Bitch)
It's okay not to like my shit
Everything's fine, drink your wine, bitch
And get offline, quit whinin', this is just a rhyme, bitch (Rhyme, bitch)
But ask me will I stick to my guns (Guns) like adhesive tape? (Adhesive tape)
Does Bill Cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak? (Huh?)
You think gettin' rid of me's a piece of cake?
I'm harder than findin' Harvey Weinstein a date (Damn)
And that's why they say I got more lines than Black Friday
So save that shit for the damn library (Shh)
You heard of Kris Kristofferson? (Yeah)
Well, I am Piss Pissedofferson (Oh)
Paul's askin' for Christmas off again
I said, No, then I spit this song for him

Bitch, I can make orange rhyme with banana (Yeah)
Oranana
Eating pork rinds, sword fightin' in pajamas
At the crib, playin' Fortnite with your grandma
But I'm more like a four-five with the grammar
'Bout to show you why your five favorite rappers can't touch this
But before I get the hammer
I should warn you, I'm Thor-like in this manner (Thor)
But the day I lose sleep over you critiquin' me or
I ever let you cocksuckers eat at me
I'd need to be a motherfuckin' pizzeria
But you ain't gettin' no cheese from me
I went from Little Caesars, BLTses, grilled cheeses
Bein' dirt poor to filthy rich, I'm still me, bitch
Like a realtor, that's real tea, bitch (Real talk)
Aftermath, bitch, whole camp's lit
We put out fire, Dre stamps it
With my cohorts, hit a bogart
Yeah, got your whole squad yellin', Oh, God
Here comes Barshall with no holds barred
Bitch, I'm a hurricane, you're a blowhard
Like your old broad, she full of semen, like the coast guard
And life's been pretty good to me so far (Yeah), for the most part
Had a couple of run-ins with popo, caught
A couple assault charges, got a few priors like crowbars (Priors)
Which is so odd 'cause I'm forty-eight now
That 5-0's startin' to creep up on me like a patrol car (Woo)
I'll be an old fart, but you don't want no part, so, bitch, don't start (Don't start)
Simmer down, compose yourself, Mozart
I ain't went nowhere, call me coleslaw
'Cause I'm out for the cabbage and I'm so raw
And if time is money, you have no clocks
And any folk caught within close proximity's gettin' cold-cocked
My enemies, I'm a chimney, give me the smoke, opps
And R.I.P. to King Von, and it don't stop, and I know not
What the fuck you say? I told y'all, it ain't me, it's my alter ego's fault
But if y'all wanna cancel me, no prob
I'll tell you the same thing I told Paul (Woo)

I can't understand a word you say (I'm tone-deaf)
I think this way I prefer to stay (I'm tone-deaf)
I won't stop even when my hair turns grey (I'm tone-deaf)

[Kehlani:]
Ashes blowing in the air.
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
Wasted youth, always on the road,
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
Fuck doing what you're told.
We're going nowhere fast.

[Eminem:]
I feel sorry for this beat.
Sympathy pains for this track.
This road is taking me back
Down memory lane with this rap.
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback.
I'm simply stating a fact:
I had Wembley Stadium packed.

But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast.
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff blows half of Madison Square up. Alas.
We perish in the blast,
But that isn't scaring us.
We pass nowhere, we're fearless
'Cause we're just

[Kehlani:]
Ashes blowing in the air.
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
We don't give a… no, no.
Wasted youth, always on the road,
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
Fuck doing what you're told, what we're told.
We're going nowhere fast.

'Cause we're going no—, going no—
Going no—, going no—, going no—,
Going nowhere.
We're on the run of our lives.
Going nowhere fast.

[Eminem:]
Fuck doing what you're told.
Act like a two-year old.
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways.
For MCs it's a funeral
When I'm devising this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning.
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me.

Gusto, guts, bravado.
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot.
I must have got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothing although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow.

But if at times my heart it seems like it's in the wrong place.
It's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve.
Keanu Reeves. Speed of life.
Avoid or veer or just steer toward it.
We're only looking forward, but
Where we're going. We have no idea.

Nowhere to go but hysterical.
It's getting warm in here. I set the world on fire.
Was born to be an arsonist.
Just one spark and it's lit,
But I'mma still get dark on this shit.
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch.

War machine? But you've forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe.
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu.
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruining your career.

But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run
I just rewind clocks.
Forever young.
Make time stop.
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
'Til the pine box. Bitch, fuck you!
I'm better than I ever was.

'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed,
It's already fucked and I'm on top.
So everyone's just

Ashes blowing in the air.
So what?
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
We don't give a… no, no.

Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.
Fuck doing what you're told, what we're told.
We're going nowhere fast.

'Cause we're going no—, going no—
Going no—, going no—, going no—,
Going nowhere.
We're on the run of our lives.
Going nowhere fast.

[Eminem:]
You can't tell us nothing.
Hard-headed and we're stubborn.
So, one ear and out the other.
When we're young
We're on the run of our lives.

Who knows what the future for us could hold.
Another shooter. Uh oh.
No more tomorrow's. We're done.
And all we are is

[Kehlani:]
Ashes blowing in the air.
So what?
Our world's on fire, but we don't care.
We don't give a… no, no.
Wasted youth, always on the road,
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold.

'Cause we're going no—, going no—
Going no—, going no—, going no—,

You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean

I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow

You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you would hold me down
But I could see it in your eyes that you're blinded by them flashing lights
And you's a stupid motherfucker for letting this thing pass you by

I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow

And I feel like everything I sow
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go

Loneliness be over
When will loneliness be over

Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same

I can't get it right
Get it right

Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain
I guess it'll never be the same
Since I fell for you
Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me
You love me then you snub me
But what can I do?

I'm still in love with you

Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my
Hopes and my dreams

But I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
She's waiting for me

So I'll make my way
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I told my dad
On the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me

I'll spend my days
Just travelling and playing shows
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose

I met a man
In a bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams

He told me, Son,
You know, I lost my true love
For the same exact reason
That you crossed the sea.

And I found truth
In people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

To cradle you with all our love
Let peace on earth be yours tonight
Under the star that shines so bright
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder
In Silent mystery
And in this spell that we are under

Make up a Christmas wish to dream on
And like the moon that shines on high
Send out your wish to that star in the sky

So what is it that you can't see

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better

Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (with my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (from my heart)
You are tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games

Baby, baby!
The love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hanging here forever
Oh baby, baby, this is not right
Let's stop this tonight

Baby, oh-oh, quit playing games
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (with my heart)
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart
I should have known from the start
You know you have got to stop (from my heart)
You are tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playing games with my heart

Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na, baby
Na na na na na na
Quit playing games with my heart
Na na na na na na
With my heart
Na na na na na, baby
My heart, my heart

There must be more to life
than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love

Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces

There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life

There must be more to life than living
There must be more than meets the eye
What good is life, if in the end we all must die
There must be more to life than this

There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this
I live in hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace

There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this

I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh, huh

Could taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright
I drove all night

What in this world
Keeps us from falling apart
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of our one heart
I think about you
When the night is cold and dark
No one can move me
The way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
Is that alright
I drove all night

I taste your sweet kisses
Your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Is that alright

I drove all night
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright

Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20′s still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

So often as I wait for sleep
I find myself reciting
The words I've or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting
The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning
I relive the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid
Along the roads I've wandered
Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you
I wouldn't change a thing that happened
On my way to you...

This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger

All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.

This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Love is all you need - baby - love is all you need.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.

To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce.

Screaming she moans, I've just been made.
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says, My advice is to not let the boys in.

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride.
You will not die, it's not poison.

Is there a hole for me to get sick in?

Saying, Death to all those who would whimper and cry.
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky

With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle.

At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.

I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after.

Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues.

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks' home in the college.

I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues.

Alright!

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed up to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!
Full speed it is, Sergeant!
Cut the cable, drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye!
Captain, Captain!

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Everyone of us (everyone of us) has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine (submarine, ah-ha)

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine

I've been standing on a corner
Since a quarter after seven
I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
At a quarter to eleven

I was watching all the people
Passing by me going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all I see were faces

And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more

The love that comes on the corner
At a quarter to eleven
I thought you were to good to be true
All my life I had believed
That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before

My cup runned overflowing
because the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more

Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more

There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs

And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
I don't understand it!

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there

There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

I don't understand it
Don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

Shot an arrow in me!

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

A suckin' ghost of jealousy

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?

Who the hell is this?
Calling me at 12:47 in the night
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?

[Kandi:]
Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?

[Nicki Minaj:]
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

[Kandi:]
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

[Nicki Minaj:]
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker

They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of hip-hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona

[Nicki Minaj:]
Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, but if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon with you
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
'Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, you'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming

I've known the smiles that melt your heart away
Those past imperfect words that lovers say
I've danced through the dawn
Kissed and closed my eyes
Yet all to soon
Those sweet hellos became good-byes
Almost love, but never quite
Never seemed exactly right
Just another love affair
Then I turned and you were there
You smiled and the world never was the same
I was in love before I even knew your name
Instantly I knew
All my life has led to you
And though the child in me was dazzled by your charms
A women was awakened in your arms
Who dreamed I could feel all the things I do
It seems all too wonderful... impossible and yet it's true
I feel I'm falling more in love with you
Each day I waken more in love with you

Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)

She was my life and my greatest star
She was my life when I lost my faith
I never knew how much she loved me
Perhaps it could be, cause she never felt like I've

She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore 
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She was my dream and my happiness
She was my friend and my deepest journey
Now I cant stand seeing her face again
Perhaps it could be, cause she's got someone else

She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore 
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She had my hand and she gave me a break 
Why did she hurt me that way

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore 
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore 
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me

She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore

Eh eh eh eh eh eh
Ohhhhhh

I know they wanna come and separate us but they can't do us nothin
You're the one I want and Imma continue lovin
Cause you're considered wifey and I'm considered husband
And Imma always be there for you
And either way you look at it I ain't goin nowhere from my muffin
Cause she gonna hold it down, can't nobody tell her nothin
You got the kind of love that always make a better fussin
And that's what gets me closer to you

And no one knows
Why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what it's like to walk in our shoes
And no one knows, the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

Seems like every day that go by things are gettin harder
Want to be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like,
I lean you on that Prada
You ain't got to match with the shoes
All about knowing you I'm into doing things to keep her longer
Stickin together forever, watch you grow stronger
That's the way it has to be, everything proper
Keepin it always true

And no one knows
Why I'm into you
Cause you'll never know what its like to walk in our shoes
And no one knows, the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That's why we'll break through

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

You are everything in my life see the joy you bring
And ain't no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that's why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don't care what they do
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

And I don't care what they say
I'm gonna be with you
I'm gonna be with you

3976,Elvis Presley,1956,Trying To Get To You,Elvis Presley,"
_x000D_
I've been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys, too
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you.

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and day
I've been running all the way
baby, trying to get to you

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us,
But they didn't mean a thing.

I just had to reach you, baby,
In spite of all that I've been through.
I kept traveling night and day,
I kept running all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do,
I would travel night and day,
And I'd still run all the way,
Baby, trying to get to you.

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through,
When my way was dark as night,
He would shine His brightest light,
When I was trying to get to you.

2626,Bob Dylan,1964,To Ramona,Another Side Of Bob Dylan,"
_x000D_
Ramona, come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise

The flowers of the city
Though breath-like, get deathlike sometimes
And there's no use in tryin'
To deal with the dyin'
Though I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements still capture the minutes I'm in

But it grieves my heart, love
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist
It's all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this

I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
Back to the South

You've been fooled into thinking
That the finishin' end is at hand
Yet there's no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

I've heard you say many times
That you're better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose

From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem
That hype you
And type you
And making you feel that you gotta be just like them

I'd forever talk to you
But soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring

Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday, maybe
Who knows, baby
I'll come and be cryin' to you

Anywhere you go I'll find you watch out
I'll be staying close behind you

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
Oh, you'd better watch out
I said, You'd better watch out

It's been kind of funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger

You'd better watch out
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you watch out
I'll be staying close behind you

And I've tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
So, you'd better watch out
Yes, I said, You'd better watch out
Watch out, watch out

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

Oh oh

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer - you're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

There's us going on about a band
Working out how we'd play our hands
I lay there dreaming
Later all alone in my bed

If I was stupid, maybe careless
So were you

When you said we'll never change, hey-yeah!
And if you think what might have been
You'll lose today

With your hair like ambered honey
To feeling warm and breezes
Let me sweetly

Let me hear your sweet, sweet laughter
And your loving conversation
And your innocent solution

Give me love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Be my lifelong passion
Give me love, love, love

You give me hands of warmth
Give me one f your hands

Give me one of your hands

Things are crashing down
She's all too tight
In my neighbourhood
She cried both day and night
I know it because it was there

It's a milestone
But she's down on her luck
And the day makes her lonely
But to make it hard to buck, now and then

I believe that she'd stop him
If she would start to care
I believe that she'd look upon
His side that used to care
And I'd go by the Lord
Anywhere she's on my way
But I don't belong there

No I don't belong to her
I don't belong to any body
She's my Christ-forsaken angel
But she don't hear me cry
She's a lone-hearted mystic
And she can't carry on
When I'm there, she's all right
But she's not when I'm gone

Heaven knows that the answer
She don't calling no one
She's the way, forsaken beauty
For she's mine, for the one
And I lost her, hesitation
By temptation as it runs
But she don't holler me
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Now I'll cry tonight
Like I cried the night before
And I'm knees on the hassle
But I'll dream about the door
It's so long, she's forsaken
By her faith, worse to tell
It don't have contonation
She smiles, fare thee well

Now when I treat to leave 'er
I was born to love her
But she knows that the kingdom awaits
So high above her
And I run a better race
But it's not too fast still
But I don't perceive her
I'm not there, I'm gone

Well it's all about diffusion
And I cry for her veil
I don't need anybody now
Beside me to tell
And it's all affirmation
I receive but it's not
She's a lone-hearted beauty
But she's gone like a spark
And she calls

Yeah, she's gone like the rain
Below the shining yesterday
But now she's home beside me
And I'd like her here to stay
She's a lone, forsaken beauty
And it don't trust anyone
And I wish I was beside her
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Well, it's too hard to stay here
And I don't want to leave
It's so bad, for so few
See, but she's a heart too hard to need
It's alone, it's a crime
The way she mauls me around
But she don't fall to hate me
But tears are gone, a painted clown

Yes, I believe that it's rightful
Oh, I believe it in my mind
I've been told like I said one night before
Carry on the cryin'
And the sole gypsy told her
Like I said, carry on
I wish I was there to help her
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Doctor said, McKinley, death is on the wall
‪Say it to me, if you got something to confess
‪I heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬
‪I heard it on the wireless radio ‬
‪From down in the boondocks way down in Key West
‪I'm searching for love, for inspiration ‬
‪On that pirate radio station
‪Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest ‬
‪Radio signal, clear as can be
‪I'm so deep in love that I can hardly see ‬
‪Down on the flatlands, way down in Key West

‪Key West is the place to be ‬
‪If you're looking for immortality ‬
‪Stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬
‪Key West is fine and fair
‪If you lost your mind, you will find it there
‪Key West is on the horizon line

‪I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
‪Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac
‪Like Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest ‬
‪Well, it might not be the thing to do ‬
‪But I'm sticking with you through and through ‬
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West
‪I got both my feet planted square on the ground ‬
‪Got my right hand high with the thumb down ‬
‪Such is life, such is happiness
‪Hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
‪If you wear one, put it behind your ear
‪Down in the bottom, way down in Key West ‬

‪Key West is the place to go
‪Down by the Gulf of Mexico ‬
‪Beyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand
‪Key West is the gateway key ‬
‪To innocence and purity ‬
‪Key West, Key West is the enchanted land

‪I've never lived in the land of Oz ‬
‪Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬
‪It's hot down here, and you can't be overdressed
‪Tiny blossoms of a toxic plant ‬
‪They can make you dizzy, I'd like to help you but I can't
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West ‬
‪Well, the Fishtail Palms, and the orchid trees
‪They can give you that bleeding heart disease
‪People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness ‬
‪On Newton Street, Bayview Park ‬
‪Walking in the shadows after dark ‬
‪Down under, way down in Key West ‬
‪I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
‪I know all the Hindu rituals ‬
‪People tell me that I'm truly blessed ‬
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West

Key West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
You stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
Feel the sunlight on your skin, and the healing virtues of the wind
Key West, Key West is the land of light

Wherever I travel, wherever I roam
I'm not that far from the convent home
I do what I think is right, what I think is best
Mystery Street off of Mallory Square
Truman had his White House there
East bound, West bound, way down in Key West
Twelve years old, they put me in a suit
Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That's my story, but not where it ends
She's still cute, and we're still friends
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
I play both sides against the middle
Trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news, I heard your last request
Fly around, my pretty little Miss
I don't love nobody, give me a kiss
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West

Key West is the place to be
If you're looking for immortality
Key West is paradise divine
Key West is fine and fair
If you lost your mind, you'll find it there
Key West is on the horizon line

Didn't I like to hold you in my hand
I was doing you no harm
I made you understand
All my life I've been that way
It happened long ago
Didn't I pray to love you through the night
I was dreaming wide awake
The early morning light shine on me
A sorry state
My heart has told me so
And the storm clouds gather overhead
No shelter we can share
Lie down on my flower bed
I got no control
I would sell my soul
To be there
So forever do or die
We just belong
Kiss hello , no wave goodbye
And the heat is stronger
For the moment when we touch
No wind can hold me
Come from loving you too much
And the nights are longer
Make it like a memory
Make it like a dream unreal
Make it like we never met
But I can't forget
It's how I feel
Make it like a memory
Take away the sound and the sight
There'll never be another love

All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that with you I'm holding on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run

Don't you love it how it all just fades away?
When your clothes don't feel the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back

Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

All of the tracks we traced we raced to reach the sun
All of the lives to find a place where we belong
All I know is that with you I'm moving on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run

And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all

If you need a hand, I can assure you this
I can help, I've got two strong arms, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good,
Let me help

It's a fact that people get lonely, ain't nothing new
But a woman like you baby, should never have the blues
Let me help, I've got two for me, let me help
It would sure do me good to do you good
Let me help

When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight and telling me everything I want to hear
Don't forget me baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, if I can do anything at all
Let me help

If your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good,
Let me help

I'd been the only one
How wonderful the moment
When the boy became a man
You warmed me in the  night
And you taught me
How to feel

And go back there again
We walked away from time
I'd  like to keep the moment
That was mine
I'd like to touch the man
I met just once
Before I go
Oh I've been to many places
And I've opened every door
I've done everything a girl could do and more

But one of the fires lit made her piss
Calling all zombies
All up inside me
Transformin' vampires
Right beside me
And you can't run
'Cause, you did, you'd be dead
And them walls can't roll from the side of my head
I beat the ghoul
My beats are cool
But here's last kiss
All suckers
They will cease to exist
I can't entertain with a beat up human
Lay waste to cities
Leave towns in ruin

Am a

Ready to blow

Baby, forever we
Together mentally
The day I leave my baby over somethin'
Then hell'll freeze
Froze

So
Let's lose our clothes like Adam Eve
Back to the basics
Step out the matrix
Step out your cool
Baby, get on my spaceship
I seen her face lit
She seen a sign like a Mason
So we ran home like a base hit
Safe
Life is whatever you think it is
Yo, what you think this is?

Uh, yeah it's all in your mind baby
You gotta do what you feel, like a blind lady
You gotta spread your wings and just fly, baby
It feel like you're reborn?
That's my baby
She said she feel it in her soul like a vibrator
I got some things for your thoughts we can try later
Let's hit the dance floor
Right before we out of time
And just party like it's 1999
You know what Prince said
Girl, you my princess
I got the glass slipper
I hope the thing fits
Your body on fire
Let me extinguish
Hop on this white horse
Ride to the sunset

Rise up and sing, rise up, rise up

Seems like dreams like I always had
Could be, should be making me glad
Why am I blue?
It's up to you to explain

I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away
Someday, some way, you'll come and say
It's you I need and you'll be pleading in vain

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wondered around, finally found somebody who

Could make me be true
Could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad
Thinking of you

Some others I've seen
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be mean
might never be cross
Or try to be boss
but they wouldn't do
but they wouldn't do

For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
marvellous you
It had to be you

I guess so

Ok!

It had to be you
Person call it faith
It had to be you
I just have to wait

I wondered around, finally found somebody who
somebody who
somebody who

For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still

It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you

Just me and you
No one but you

That left us on the floor

If we go to Brighton

Everything will lighten up

Darling, don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go

I'll stop eating food
And I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
Maybe, I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you

And sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you squeeze me
[Acoustic version:] And you breathe me
'Til these thoughts leave my head

If it gets too complicated
I'll give up and be frustrated
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been hated
[Acoustic version:] If you feel like you've been jaded and
This love's too overrated
See what's going on, mmm

Darling, don't be nervous

Take me back to Albert Road

And I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
Then I could speak my mind and tell you

Once upon a thrill from a kiss to a swill
We were swallowing the nights like we had nine lives

Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so...

We were borderline kids with a book of disorders
Medicating everyday to keep the straightness in order

Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

It's the false side of hope, where believers concede
And there's only memories, when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do, the plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

Once upon before we were brilliant and bored
Two dashes of the bitters, add some ice and you pour

Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone
Dead and gone so long, seventeen so gone

It's the false side of hope, where believers concede
And there's only memories, when it's over

So pour out some liquor, make it an old fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do, the plank and the passion
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
They were the best of times, they were the best of times
Of your life

(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)
Now it looks like a wasteland
(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)
Not the way that we remember
(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)
One more sip for the past
(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)
And always tip your bartenders

Get boozy, boozy, boozy
Get boozy, boozy, boozy
Get boozy, boozy, boozy
Get boo...

So pour out some liquor, make it an old fashioned
Remember your youth, in all that you do, the plank and the passion

They were the best of times, they were the best of times

Cause it's like it's not going nowhere
And you gon' see it wherever there's struggle
I see my pain in your eyes man
So I know you're feelin' me
It's that twinkle man
That sign of struggle
I've seen it
In me

Cause everyday I can't help but see it
People ain't satisfied
And you're hatin' your 9 to 5
Everybody wanna live another life
But every goal or mountain you climb
Not to better your day
That do leave room for people to say
I guess you're livin' better now
Share a little of that cheddar now
Cause I remember days back when
A brother was hustlin and robbin' too
I done tossed up a letter now
On a whole nother level now
Still I can't enjoy my fame
Unless my people doin' the same
And gettin' money too

Once in awhile
(and see the twinkle in your eyes)
And I can see that you never wanna struggle no more
(Once in awhile I couldn't look at you)
Once in awhile
(and see the twinkle in your eyes)
And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more

Cause everytime you ask me, I'm grindin'
It shouldn't have to be that way
You shouldn't have to pay my way
I shouldn't have to want for a brighter day
Got a little problem on the way
Bounty hunters checkin' state to state
Child support lady on your case
Not to mention tickets you ain't never paid

Oh
Is what you'll be askin'
God please hold it down for me
Don't let satan get ahold of me
I'm tryin' to tell you it can happen to me too
But it happened a lot worse to my brother
Muhammad thank God he recovered

Once in awhile

And I can see that you never wanna struggle no more

Once in awhile

And I can see that you don't ever wanna cry no more
(Once in awhile I choose look at you)
I see your pain now
I can feel you strain now
And I can see you cryin'
And inside you're dyin
We're all the same now
But you got to make change now

Once in awhile

And I can see that you don't ever struggle no more

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell,
Blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl,
Year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.

_x000D_
Do you ever get that feeling
When the guilt begins to hurt
Seeing all the children
Wallowing in dirt
Crying out with hunger
Crying out in pain
At least the dirt will wash off
When it starts to rain

Soap won't wash away your shame

Do you ever get that feeling
That something isn't right
Seeing your brother's fists
Clenched ready for the fight
Soon the fighting turns to weapons
And the weapons turn to wounds
So the doctors stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch

Surgery won't improve your pain

It all seems so stupid
It makes me want to give up
But why should I give up
When it all seems so stupid

Do you ever get the feeling
That something can be done
To eradicate these problems
And make the people one
Do you ever get that feeling
Something like a nagging itch
And all the while the doctors
Stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch

Hope alone won't remove the stains
Shame

Some of you all never been down South too much...
I' gonna tell you a little story, so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields,
and it looks something like a turnip green.
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad.
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
she'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it...
Carry it home and cook it for supper, 'cause that's about all they had to eat,
But they did all right.

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman

Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack

Polk salad Annie
'Gators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
'Cause the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, dispiteful, straight-razor totin' woman,
Lord have mercy.

Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah

But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck

For once Polk salad Annie
'Gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang

Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention

King Creole

There's a man in New Orleans
Who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man
With a great big soul
He lays down a beat
Like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip shaking King Creole

When the king starts to do it
It's as good as done
He holds his guitar
Like a Tommy gun
He starts to growl
From way down his throat
He bends a string
And that's all she wrote

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip shaking King Creole

Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about pork and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip shaking King Creole

Well, he plays something evil
Then he plays something sweet
No matter what he plays
You got to get up on your feet

When he gets the rockin' fever
Baby, heaven sakes
He don't stop playin'
'Till his guitar breaks

You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumpin' like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip shaking King Creole

Machines. [repeat]

It's a machine's world.
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul.
When the machines take over,
It ain't no place for rock'n'roll.

They tell me I don't care,
But deep inside I'm just a man.

They freeze me, they burn me,
They squeeze me, they stress me.
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me,
But no one, but no one, but no one can wrest me away.

Back to humans.

We have no disease, no troubles of mind.
We are fighting for peace, no regard for the time.
We never cry, we never retreat.
We have no conception of love or defeat.

What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea.
It's that machine, boys
With random-access memory.

Never worry, never mind.
Not for money, not for gold.

Its software, its hardware,
Its heartbeat, its time-share,
Its midwife's a disk drive,
Its sex life is quantised.
Its self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.

When the site was found
We laid the foundations down
It didn't take long before
They came back tumbling down
Don't build at night
You need a little light
How else are you going to see
What it is going to be like

So we picked up our tools
And we worked in the morning light
With the last stone placed
Wasn't it a wonderful site
But it fell back down
And scattered all around
Anything passes
When you need glasses

My monument
It feel down
My monument
It feel down

Work all of my days for this kind of praise
It fell down
Work all of my days
It fell down

Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

Second hand pearls

At first I thought that I was dreamin'
But then I heard the voice of a girl and it sounded like she'd been cryin'
Now I'm too worried to be sleepin'

So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked up on her door
She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing

She said, I think your ears are playing tricks on you
Sweater zipped up to her chin
Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing
She said, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind
She said, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind

So I was layin' on the floor of my room, cold concrete on my back
No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
I didn't want to intrude because I knew that I didn't have all the facts
But I couldn't bear the thought of leavin' her

So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked up on her door

We can talk about the noise, when you're ready, but till then
I'll say, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind
I'll say, It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind

A daydream spills from my corked head
Breaks free of my wooden neck
Left a nod over sleeping waves
Like bobbing bait for bathing cod
Floating flocks of candled swans
Slowly drift across wax ponds

The men all played along
To marching drums
And boy did they have fun
Behind the sea
They sang (hey!)
So our matching legs
Are marching clocks
And we're all too small
To talk to God
Yes, we're all too smart
To talk to God

Toast the fine folks casting silver crumbs
To us from the dock
Jinxed things ringing as they leak
Through tiny cracks in the boardwalk
Scarecrow, now it's time to hatch
Sprouting sons and ageless daughters

Don't you know
Don't you know
That those watermelon smiles
Just can't ripen underwater
Just can't ripen underwater

The men all played along
To marching drums
And boy did they have fun
Behind the sea
They sang (hey!)
So our matching legs
Are marching clocks
And we're all too small
To talk to God
Yeah, we're all too smart
To talk to God
Oh, we're all too smart
To talk to God

Alone tonight
Me here tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine

She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?

Susie got your number, and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right

Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my-Take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)

I never knew, but I was walking the line
Come go with me, I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone

Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

10 years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain't your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right

A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart

So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around

It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it

You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby

By the banks of her own lagoon

Sunday's on the phone to Monday

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Make love, not war, we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl
That grows up in this world

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

There's hunger everywhere
We've got to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes the world go round
It's easy to forget
If you don't hear the sound of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

You've got to take a stand
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
If you don't hear the sound
Love makes the world go round

Don't judge a man
Until you've been standing in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away

You know that what I say is true

Love love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round
Love makes the world go round

Make love, not war, we say

Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, all your problems
Everything, and follow me

If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish
You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)

Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it
The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it

Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)

Of war and peace the truth just twists
Its curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattered sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom 'cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

If you're in old habits
Set in your old ways
Changes are a-comin'
For these are changing days

And if your head is in the sand
While things are goin' on
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit

Now if you're in the habit
To let your temper fly
When you talk with people
Who don't see eye to eye

And if you don't believe it
There's a newer world ahead
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit

A change of habit, a change of outlook
A change of heart, you'll be alright
The halls of darkness, have doors that open
It's never too late to see the light

So if you're in the habit
Putting people down
Just because they're different
From the wrong side of town

Well, don't count on any medals, son
They're pinning none on you
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit

A change of habit, a change of outlook
A change of heart, you'll be alright
The halls of darkness, have doors that open
It's never too late to see the light

So if you're in the habit
Of putting people down
Just because they're different
From the wrong side of town

Well, don't count on any medals, son
They're pinning none on you
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit

Change of habit, hmm, change of habit

(You see)

I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now, I find
I've changed my mind

(You see)
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
(You see)

I traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone
I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Mmm, ooh, mmm
No famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No Ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmm, mmm

The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love, mmm
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

Now I find I've changed my mind

You know I been trying to figure out
Just what's going on
Am I over her?
I been doing a lot of thinking lately
Am I over her?
And I'm really missing you

It's been 3 months, 3 hours, 3 days
Since the last time I seen your pretty face
My decision to bring this to an end
And I'm caught up in reminiscing
Having faithful visions of long walks, long talks
Play fights, late nights
It's been on my mind since Valentine's
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide

I ask myself time and time again
Again, I'm trying to comprehend that
Unanswered questions still
Things to be are meant to end

Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her?
Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my, my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

I was going through some things that I couldn't explain
Now my situation's taking a big change
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town
Now I'm kinda wishing you would come back around
Is she sad or is she mad?
Does she have a new man, does she have it like that?
It's been so long, thought I would've moved on
Could've been strong and picked up the telephone

I ask myself time and time again
Again, I'm trying to comprehend that
Unanswered questions still
Things to be are meant to end

Am I over her? (am I over her?)
Am I over her? Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my, my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her
Am I really over my love?

It's water under the bridge
But I can't seem to forget
All the plans we made, all the time we spent
Makes me reminisce
I still see your face, all this love I can't replace
Am I over (am I over)
Am I over her? (her now)

Am I over her?
Am I over her? (am I?)
Am I over her? (am I over?)
Tell me am I really over my my love (my love, my love)
I can't think straight (my love)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (never gonna be over her)
Am I really over my love? (never gonna be)

No, am I over her? (am I over her?)
No, not over her, no
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
Am I over her?

Am I over her? (over her?)
Am I over her? Am I over her?
Tell me am I really over my, my love (am I over her?)
I can't think straight (am I over her?)
Cause I'm too busy thinking of her (I'm not over her)
Am I really over my love?

I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home

Going in alone
Fire up the engine
Stoke the coal
Floating on a feeling
Fighting with the tide
Hoping you'll be home for
Christmas time

And happiness is far away

You can't have glory without the pain
You can't have freedom without the chains
It's a fragile existence, a delicate system
This life is a balancing game

I thought I could tip the scales, cheat the game
Have the sun without the rain
Take your love
And not exchange my heart for yours
I guess that it's me to blame

So this is what I found
From the bridges I burned down
That it all comes back around
Now I know

You can't have glory without the pain
You can't have freedom without the chains
It's a fragile existence, a delicate system
This life is a balancing game

So then I called you up to make amends
Said, Take me back
And you said, Yes
But now I know just how it ends
You played the game, like me, it was all pretend

So this is what I've learnt
You can't take and not return
Because one day you'll get burned, and now I know

You can't have glory without the pain
You can't have freedom without the chains

I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders

Like a whiskey

I never knew that love was blind
'Till I was hers
But she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn
I let it burn, yeah
The feeling, it was bittersweet
Realizing I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn

It's knowin' that your door is always open
And you path is free to walk
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

It's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the heat stains that have dried up on some lovin'
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns mellowed by me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we'd fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin'
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours
You're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Till' the join might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you
Walking in the back roads
By the rivers flowing gently on my mind

I dip my cup of soup from a gurgling,
cracking cauldron in some train yard
I'm barely runnin' cold how
Have a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Who cupped hands around the tin cans
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smiling never changes on my mind

Serre ton bonheur quand il vient

Du fleuve rouge et mauve qui coule en nos seins
Ses dangers, ses ravins

Pleure la lumière quand elle meure
Puis hurle sous la lune comme ça l'air de rien
Devant la nuit immense et jusqu'au matin
Va toucher le lointain

Au-dessus de nous, dedans et tout autour
Le miracle est partout mon amour
Sauras-tu le voir

Au cœur de nos cœurs, au-delà des contours
Le miracle est partout mon amour
C'est à toi de le voir

Terre ta douleur quand elle brille
Partage tes envies, tes jeux, tes prodiges
Le long de tes racines ces voix qui grésillent
Va défier tes vertiges

Brûle ton amour quand il brûle
Fais feu de tout le bois dont tes bras disposent
Étonne-toi du fond de ta moindre cellule
N'oublie jamais les roses

Au dessus de nous dedans et tout autour
Le miracle est partout mon amour
Sauras-tu le voir

Au cœur de nos cœurs, au-delà des contours
Le miracle est en nous mon amour
C'est à toi de le voir

Au cœur de nos cœurs et dans le point du jour
Le miracle est en nous mon amour

It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both

I tried and tried to let you know
I love you but I'm letting go
It may not last but I don't know
Just don't know

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep

Built a wall around my heart
I’ll never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

If you don't know
Then you can't care
And you show up
But you're not there
But I'm waiting
And you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Though we have not hit the ground
It doesn't mean we're not still falling,
Oh I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame, I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then the fact remains

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Everyday
With every worthless word we get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

Dans mes absences, parfois, sans doute
J'aurais pu m'éloigner
Comme si j'avais perdu ma route
Comme si j'avais changé

Alors j'ai quelques mots tendresse
Juste pour le dire

Je ne vous oublie pas, non, jamais
Vous êtes au creux de moi
Dans ma vie, dans tout ce que je fais

Mes premiers amours
Mes premiers rêves sont venus avec vous
C'est notre histoire à nous

Je ne vous oublie pas, non, jamais
Vous savez tant de moi
De ma vie, de tout ce que j'en fais

Alors mes bonheurs, mes déchirures se partagent avec vous
C'est notre histoire à nous
Je ne vous oublie pas

Parce que le temps peut mettre en cage
Nos rêves et nos envies
Je fais mes choix et mes voyages
Parfois j'en paye le prix
La vie me sourie ou me blesse
Quelle que soit ma vie

Je ne vous oublie pas, non, jamais
Vous êtes au creux de moi
Dans ma vie dans tout ce que je fais

Mes premiers amours
Mes premiers rêves sont venus avec vous
C'est notre histoire à nous

Je ne vous oublie pas

Même à l'autre bout de la terre
Je continue mon histoire avec vous

Je ne vous oublie pas

Non, Jamais
Vous êtes au creux de moi
De ma vie de tout ce que je fais
Mes premiers amours

Non jamais

Vous savez tant de moi

Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
(It's one of those kinda nights)

Yes, this beat's takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin' her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like Goddamn
She's like That's harassment, I'm like Yeah, and? (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That's the best ass I've seen in a while
We should be datin', she's from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (since an addy)
She said Fuck off and threw her liquor at me
It's one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like Oh, my God, my whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em
I said Oh, my God, you know my songs, that's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?
She said No, I'm bi
She said Are you drunk?, I said No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick, she said So am I
What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl where the rest of that promethazine at
She said cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe and bring the lean back
Then I said

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda—

OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, Go with you where? She said Out
I said I'm a candle, I go out if you blow on me
Walk her out to the parkin' lot
Here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said Let's pull over
She said No problemo, windows are dark tint
Roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Getting head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi
I'm comin', you're going

If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then the smoke and the bottle are on me
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive we probably won't leave
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

If you're part of my love
Don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world's a tiny bubble
Floating inside
Those of us who notice are
Expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble
Floating inside, the truth

When I look in your eyes
I can see the sky
Shining down upon the perfect garden
All the world's a tiny bubble
Floating inside
Those of us who notice are
Expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble
Floating inside the truth

You can't imagine just what I've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we

If you're part of my love
Don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world's a tiny bubble

Unleash the dog on you

Run it back 
And I got technology, X-ray vision

What the hell you take me for?

Run it back 
Bang, bang, choo-choo train, baby
Put that thing on me
You'd rather see my mainframe, not the cage
And see another side of me
And she be like, T-minus 7 before my system shuts down

I think I'm 'bout to shut it down right now

Quand marcher sans autre but
Plus de passe demain fourbu
Dans le neant du froid de la rue

When walking without any other goal

No past tomorrow broken down

In the cold's nothing of the street
Quand les mots n'existent plus
Quand l'esperance oubliee, dissolue
Quand les alcools meme ne saoulent plus
Restent les phrases ecorchees
De ces phrases qu'on jette avant de renoncer

When words no longer exists

When hope forgotten, dissolved

When even alcohols no more make drunk

Remain the scratched phrases

From those phrases we throw before giving away
Les derniers seront les premiers
Dans l'autre realite
Nous serons princes d'eternite

Lasts will be firsts

In the other reality

We'll be princes of eternity
Un billet sur le trottoir
Dans un journal d'autres histoires
Un rayon de soleil au hasard

A bill on the sidewalk

In a newspaper other stories

A sun ray randomly
Une fleur abandonnee
Ce que les autres ont laisse de cote
Plus assez neuf, plus assez
Quand ta place est au-dehors
Ne reste que ces phrases comme ile au tresor

An abandonned flower

What others leaved by

Not new enough, not enough

When your place is outside

Leaving only these phrases as treasure island
Les derniers seront les premiers

We'll be princes of eternity

Dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you

Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away

Far away

You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again

And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you
I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still gone to pack my bags

You didn't know me

You couldn't show me

But I don’t know why

Now I want it all the time
But I know that it's no crime
But I don’t know why

Now we're holding all the time
Two can sing to no longer mind
I hope that you will see me through
Through the Backdoor
Looking out for a jack-door
For all the things that we hoped for
Thrown it in a pool of fear
Pool of fear

Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home

Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun

Getting nowhere
On our way back home

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Eminem:]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night, but tonight I am

One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
It was come sunlight, scram, now we hug tight, and...

He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

Always the bridesmaid, never “The bride, hey!”
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?

You know what I mean
It's like walking in the heat all day with no water
It's like waiting for a friend
Watching everybody else meet theirs on that corner
Or losing in an argument
Though you're right, can't get your thoughts in order

Still I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain

But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oooooo oh I've
I've told you now

You know what I mean
Although I try my best, I still let down the team
You're everything I want,
Why should I resist when you are there for me?

Should I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain

But what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh the truth spills out
And oooooo oh I've
I've told you now

I've told you now
And I've told you now!
And I've told you now!

Still I refrain
From talking at you, talking on
You know me well
I don't explain

So what the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?
Wasting all my precious time
What the hell
Why do you think I come 'round here on my own will?
Wasting all my precious time
Oh, the truth spills out
And oooooo oh I've
I've told you now

Je suis une fille bien ordinaire
Des fois j'ai plus l'goût de rien faire
J'f'rai d'la musique, autour d'un verre
Avec ma mère, mes soeurs, mes frères
Mais faut que j'pense à ma carrière
Je suis un chanteuse populaire

Vous m'voyez comme une déesse
Je suis une femme, pas une princesse
Si j'peux vous faire un aveu
C'est quand je chante, que j'me sens mieux
Mais ce métier-là, c'est dangereux
Plus on en donne plus l'monde en veut

Un jour, quand je serai trop lasse
Je songerai à donner ma place
J'f'rai mes adieux avec classe
J'espère vous laisser une trace
Et clamer la vie dans vos coeurs
Que de l'amour, que du bonheur

J'aime mon prochain, j'aime mon public
Tout c'que je veux, c'est que ça clique
J'me fous pas mal de la critique
Quand je chante, c'est pour le public
J'suis pas un animal de cirque
Ma vie à moi c'est la musique

Si je chante c'est pour qu'on m'entende
Quand je crie c'est pour me défendre
J'aimerais bien me faire comprendre
Je voudrais faire le tour de la terre
Avant d'mourir puis qu'on m'enterre
Voir de quoi l'reste du monde a l'air

Autour de moi il y a la guerre
Le peur, la faim et la misère
J'voudrais qu'on soit tous des frères
C'est pour ça qu'on est sur la terre
J'suis pas qu'une chanteuse populaire
Je suis rien qu'une femme bien ordinaire

Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore...

Don't tread on me

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as the lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance

Don't tread on me

So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war

Her hair is soft and her eyes are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be,
But she's not you.

She knows just how to make me laugh when I feel blue
She's everything a man could want,
But she's not you.

And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from
Whispering your name

She even kisses me like you used to do.
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you.

And it's just breaking my heart

Dressed, why?
We've got cocktails at the Cosden's. We said we'd drop by
Do we have to?
Then, there's dinner at the Dodges', the reception at the Rose's
I think I'm gonna die.
So how about we just stay home?
Could we do that? I like your thinking

You are the best thing that ever has happened to me,
You are.
Okay then, one of the best things that's happened to me.
You are.
You think I'd find someone.
Who could surprise me.
And size me up without cutting me down.
Ain't this a town? (Sure it is)

You are the god-damnd'est thing that has happened to me...
Ever (Sorry)
When did I have this much happiness happen to me?
Never.
I can't believe my luck.
And all I can do
Is be the best thing that's happened to you.

So what do you say we just stay home?
What do you say we just go out on the boat and get smashed
And make love on the beach and stare up at the moon?

You might just be the best thing that has happened to me,
Well, so far (So far?)
Of course, not much very good's ever happened to me,
So far (Me too)
I never much liked love.
I always fought it.
I never thought it would happen like this...
Give us a kiss.

We might just be the best thing that has happened to us,

You happen to be,

They ask me am I ok
They ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy
And they genuinely care
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
And I continuosly stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now
But somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dawg you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck am I supposed to get over you

Doody, that's what we call each other
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
We was always brothers
Never thought about each others' skin colours
Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn
Tryna walk under the trees
Just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
When I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and like
No I won't, I'm black stupid
And black people they got melatonin
In their skin, we don't burn
Meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them playboy rings
My mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got em back
Shit it must have been at least 16 years ago
Well I put em in your cask-ahhh
Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget

And this may sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang it up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all of me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
It feels like our General just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pages
All our cell numbers has changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is there all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dawg
I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation
And truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to
Throw them balls back on Dresden
From making cars to paintballing
Getting arrested
To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court
So we got off on a technicality, left sweating
Me, you and what's his face
I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral
He betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54
Just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

Together we'll sail across the sea reminiscing every night (shine on silvery moonlight)

We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino

Get a new facial
Start a sensational

As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up
Cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food?
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her
And she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty and lastly

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

And we’ve got that love in us
So if the drink kill us
We’re gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
Say I hate wasps too
I don’t really dance
So I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here
I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What you’re wearing

And I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone, oh.

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

She’s like the fast food
I’ll regret it after
And I needed money
But I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

Now tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

I want someone to come home to
I need somewhere I can sleep
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones
And have a conversation not too deep

Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is
They've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains
Someone letting them be

I want someone who can save me
When I come home from the zoo
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator
I can give my alligator to

Everybody seem to know what they are talking about
And I can see why it is
They got someone breaking them out
Someone finding a key
Someone setting them free

Could you be that person for me?
Would you feel right setting me free?
Would you dare to find my key?

I want someone who can bail me
When I get up to my tricks
I need somebody used to dealing with a sinner
Whenever I get in I fix

Everybody else busy doing better than me
And I can see why it is
They've got someone setting them free
Someone breaking the chains
Someone letting them be

Could you be that person for me
Would you feel right setting me free
Could you dare to find my key?

I've been thinking about you
More than I want to
Spinning me around in this web
Getting in my heart and my head
Hanging on every word
Pretending they don't hurt
Wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time I hear you speak
But you do
Yes, you do

I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Tell me, who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)

Can't fight this feeling
My heart's too revealing
Even though it's making me a fool
Can't tell love when it's tried or it's true
You're the one pulling me close
You're the one that I need the most
I wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time you're next to me
But you do
Yes, you do

I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Tell me, who let you in
Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you, how did you)
Ohh
Ohh how did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here?
How did you get here?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die

[Chorus - 2Pac]
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style,

Try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style

Putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead I'm the diamond in the dirt,
That ain't been found I'm the underground king and
I ain't been crowned When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like
Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go ahead, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
If it wasn't for rain Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain

[Chorus - 2Pac]
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts but my force was wild

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would have been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
Marshall, you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch, you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien and just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainie these food stamps and this WIC shit
Cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here

Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat

Hello, misfortune, how's my old friend Mr. Misery?
I've been away so long
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me

I got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

Met a little honey
At the Buzzin' Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, I did
One drink and all my money
And that honey bee had flown away

I'm 'bout as low as I can go
I don't really mean to complain
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain

I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things

Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping's impossible too
Everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?

It's not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?
It's better that we break…

A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane

The city looks so nice from here
Pity, I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there, it disappears
It disappears

It's not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?
It's better that we break up

Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile and you're cold
But that's all right
Life these days is getting rough
They've knocked you down and beat you up
But it's just a roller-coaster anyway, yeah

It's not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?

Look, if I were to rap
About the crap
That's out
That's the route
You'd probably want me to take
'Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers

If I was to say something about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants
'Cause I'm white, and he's white
So he's like my competition
I mean, right?

Nope, Paul Wall is dope
And so's Bubba, so
But I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali Shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum
Like I'm asleep it's awesome
I'm like a sleeping giant
And when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem

I was taught if you're gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why
Look them dead in the eye
Then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls for this rap game and it goes
1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3 (check, check) 1, 2, 3
That ain't the hook, now follow me

There's nothing else for me to say
My public adores me
Everybody bores me
They're just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers, Come nearer.

My darling
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

Shady, I know you're in there somewhere. Come here
Talk to me, sit. Here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair?
Dye it back, come on, try it.
Ah, no, I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
But I'm here to rebuild you.
But I already killed you!
But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother.
Yeah so what of her?
You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes.
Fuck you motherfucker! I had you beat
No I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time
Your soul's mine
I'm taking it back.
You fucking bitch why!?
Because I love you. Look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster?
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

My darling
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling

And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling

Shady, listen...
(Shady!)
You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back
But I don't want it back!
Yes you do.
No I don't!
Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!
No I won't!
I'mma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
Well I got him on the phone right now!
(Slim!)
You're lying
Yo Slim
How, why now! What up Dre?
Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs, you became a lot softer
But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back, and let me know what's up
Fuck this mirror!
I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
Put the gun down
Bye bye!
OK I'm still alive
So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
You sold your soul to me. Need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal
Well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right ooh?
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too
That you're just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall.
What!
No one's gonna love you like I do!

My darling
I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling

I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
'Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

I said, I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling

Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die

Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

They'll be so, they'll be so lonely baby
They get so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Now, the bell hop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never, never look back

And they get so, they get so lonely baby
Well they are so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Well, now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel

Where you will be, you will be so lonely baby
Well you will be lonely
You'll be so lonely, you could die

Although it's always crowded
But you still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers to cry there in their gloom

Where they get so, they get so lonely baby
Well they're so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die

Wait
I know you got a lot of shit you like to say
(To say, to say)
Slow it down, think you're getting a little carried away
You're too close to the flame
But you don't wanna turn around
Like you got me figured out
But girl what I can promise is I let you down
So don't put up a fight, you'll get lost in the light

If you keep staring at the Sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance I will fuck up again
I warned you in advance
But you just keep on staring at the Sun

Wait
I know I got a lot of shit going on with me
Now we're free to loving anyone other than me
I try to rewind I reminded that time don't wait for nobody
Can't get too close, no, let it go
'Cause I can count on you to let me down
I won't put up a fight, I got lost in the light

If you keep staring at the Sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance I will fuck up again
I warned you in advance
But you just keep on staring at the Sun

Wait
Got a couple little things I would like to say
Today is not your day
You should walk away
But you won't listen, you just keep on

Staring at the Sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance I will fuck up again

Fragile
Like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me
I'd never willingly
Do you harm

Apologies
Are all you ever seem to get from me
But just like a child
You make me smile
When you care for me
And you know...

It's a question of lust
It's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Independence
Is still important for us though (we realise)
It's easy to make
The stupid mistake
Of letting go (do you know what I mean)

My weakness
You know each and every one (it frightens me)
But I need to drink
More than you seem to think
Before I'm anyone's
And you know...

It's a question of lust
It's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Kiss me goodbye
When I'm on my own
But you know that I'd
Rather be home

It's a question of lust
It's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

You with a smile

Hold me 'cause I'm sure I'm hated
Promises, they are overrated
Wait just a while, while I'm
Drowning in denial

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue

Watch me 'cause I'm on a mission
Hold me back, so I'm forced to listen
Don't let me go 'cause I'm nothing
Without you

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you
Don't let go I need your rescue

Turn me into someone like you
Find a place that we can go to
Run away and take me with you

It really meant a lot to be
In someone else's thoughts
Someone else's mind
Someone else as kind, as you

The thoughtfulness you showed has made
A difference in my life
I won't forget how unafraid
You were that long dark night 
I thought that all was lost
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind, as you

I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there, for me

How kind of you to stick by me
During the final bout
And listen to the referee
As I was counted out 
I thought my time was up
I thought I'd never find
A someone quite as kind, as you

I thought my faith had gone
I thought there couldn't be
A someone who was there, for me

How kind of you to think of me

Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Hey, what about yesterday
(What about us)
What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)
I can't even breathe
(What about us)
What about apathy
(What about us)
I need you
(What about us)
What about nature's worth
(Ooh, ooh)
It's our planet's womb
(What about us)
What about the holy land
(What about it)
Torn apart by creed
(What about us)
What about the common man
(What about us)
Can't we set him free
(What about us)
What about children dying
(What about us)
Can't you hear them cry
(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
(Ooo, ooo)
Someone tell me why
(What about us)
What about baby Boy
(What about it)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
(What about us)
What about the man
(What about us)
What about the crying man
(What about us)
What about Abraham
(What was us)
What about death again
(Ooh, ooh)
Do we give a damn

Oh, oh, people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man.

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare.
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.

Oh, oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand.

Oh, oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove.

He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days.

From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all around will be your dow'ry

Oh, oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

Oh, oh, oh, oh and two by two my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain

Oh flee for your life
Who heed me not let all your treasure make you
Oh fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Ah people can you hear me?
And now I know, and now I know
And now I know, and now I know
That you can hear me
And now I know, and now I know
And now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know
The earth will shake in two will break
Death all around around around around
Around around around around
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
Now I know

I feel the salty waves come in
I feel them crash against my skin
And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
There's a haze above my TV
That changes everything I see
And maybe if I continue watching
I'll lose the traits that worry me

Can we fast-forward 'til you go down on me?

Stop there and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here

Can we fast-forward 'til you go down on me?

Taking everything for granted but we still respect the time
We move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine
And I would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines
But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside

Can we fast-forward 'til you go down on me?

Stop there and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here
Catch me up I'm getting out of here

More to the point, I need to show
How much I can come and go
Other plans fell through
And put a heavy load on you
I know there's no more that need be said
When I'm inching through your bed
Take a look around instead and watch me go

Stop there and let me correct it
I wanna live a life from a new perspective
You come along because I love your face
And I'll admire your expensive taste
And who cares divine intervention
I wanna be praised from a new perspective
But leaving now would be a good idea
So catch me up on getting out of here

It's not fair, just let me perfect it
Don't wanna live a life that was comprehensive
'Cause seeing clear would be a bad idea
Now catch me up on getting out of here
So catch me up I'm getting out of here

Can we fast-forward 'til you go down on me?
Can we fast-forward 'til you go down?

I can’t ask you to fulfill my expectations that you gave me 
After we first touched

But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist

I can’t wait much longer till you tell me baby
There’s some chance we’ll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I’ll be in with half a chance
I can’t wait till I hear you tell me that you want me 
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me 
Got my demons doing such a happy dance

Hey! Ah! Yeah!

Exorcise my demons, cast them out today 
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there’s a chance
I don’t want to sit and watch my demons dance

Watch my demons dance

When I closed my eyes and tried to dream
Darkness was the only thing I could see

I had run out of hope
Reached the end of the road
Hit the rocks at the bottom with no farther to go
But just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

I can't believe I'm falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love once again

When you take my hand you hold my heart
And I know everything will be alright
When you touch me there I feel it everywhere
I'm loving things I never thought I would like

Cuando amanece

Tu amor aparece
Y me hace féliz
Me conoces bien
Y sabes también

Que nadie te querrá
Como yo
Tú me haces sentir
Deseos de vivir,
Junto a ti por siempre

Tú amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama
Tú eres quien gana
En mi corazón
Porque me has dado

Algo sagrado
Con tu pasión
Me conoces bien
Y sabes también

Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estás
No hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida

Si tú te vas
Todo mi amor eres tú
Todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás

No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tú
Noche de estrellas

Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera

Todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo se
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo
Vivo por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien

Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tú amor
Todo mi amor eres tú
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tú

Cuando no estás
No hay quien me dé
Lo que das tú
Pues todo mi amor eres tú

Cambiaremos al mundo mañana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adiós a la tristeza
Es mi vida y
Quiero estar junto a ti

Todo mi amor eres tú

Todo mi amor eres tú
(And I can't stop!)

Cuando no estás
No hay quien me dé lo que das tú

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He can become my little problem
'Cause it look like he modeling clothes in Dublin
So, I think he that getting that green, a goblin
Hear through the grapevine that he hang low
We can shoot a movie, can bang like Rambo
Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wondering if he can understand my lingo

'Cause I know he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them g-g-games
I'mma run away-ay, I'mma run away-ay-ay

I-I-I wanna give you one last option

If-if you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight, and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom

Boy, I'm in this club slow-mo
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you feeling me from the jump
I wanna ride too
You got that hot shit, boy, you blessed
Let me feel up on your chest
Flex it, you the man
You the man, one-hundred grand
The same old game, blow
Yes, I play it very well
Come, baby, lay it down, let me stay down
Let me show you how I run things in my playground
Come and get this va va voom voom (woo woo)

There is somethin' that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch

Listen easy, you can hear God calling
Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me, your hair's softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Saying nothing, lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sighs
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we've found
I, hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Now now now now now now now

Young birds flying, and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
No the grass won't pay no mind

You still stuck around and stayed by my side.

Been all about the world,
Ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through.
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run,
And I would be out chasing you.

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be,
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely.

Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone).
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long).
I just want you to call my phone.
So, stop playing, girl, and come on home (come on home).
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout (no).
I want me and you to work it out (work it out).
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby).

Tell me a piece of your history
that you're proud to call your own
Speak in words you picked up
 as you walked through life alone
We used to swim in your stories
 and be pulled down by their tide
Choking on the water, drowning, with no air in sight

Now you've hit a wall and it's not your fault
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard,
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words in that head of yours
And oh, oh can you feel the silence?
I can't take it anymore
Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill the silence?

Tell me a piece of your history 
that you've never said out loud
Pull the rug beneath my feet 
and shake me to the ground
Wrap me around your fingers,
break the silence open wide
Before it seeps into my ears
and fills me up from the inside

Now you've hit a wall and you're lost for words
My dear, my dear, my dear
Now you've hit a wall and you hit it hard
My dear, my dear, oh dear

It is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill this silence?
You must have the words in that head of yours
And oh, oh can you feel the silence?
I can't take it anymore
'Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill the silence?

If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?
If you give it a name then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?  

Cause it is not enough to be dumbstruck
Can you fill the silence?
You must have the words in that head of yours
Oh, oh, can you feel the silence?
I can't take it anymore,

Angry words and bitterness are slow to fade away
What happened to the dreams and hopes that we shared yesterday?
Mystic chords of memory that stir within our soul
Lead us to forgiveness so that we can be made whole

We are not enemies, there is no good in that
There are better angels that surround us all
And we will find a way through all our differences
Hear the better angels, listen to their call

Hatred only breeds more hate and darkness in our heart
May we find compassion in a world so torn apart
A symphony of what could be
Says this is where we start

We are not enemies, there is no good in that
There are better angels that surround us all
And we will find a way through all our differences
Hear the better angels, listen to their call

Let our better angels be our guide
Yes, let our better angels walk beside
Can you catch us all
'Cause we're just about to fall
Rise up!
And find better angels in us all
Yes, rise up!
It's time! Ohhh, it's time!

We are not enemies, there is no good in that
There are better angels, they surround us all
And we will find a way through all our differences
Hear the better angels, listen to their call

And we will find a way

I wish I could believe you, relieve my tension.
By telling something that I want to hear.
But you won't, will you?

I resign myself to a day of frustration,
I can't hide the feelings that I've found.
Your sentimental touch fills my heart with elation.
Are we gonna kick this off the ground?

Excuse me for my hesitation I've, I've met you before
Your face seems so familiar and longing for more
Your eyes they tell me something that I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth and the truth is
You're miles away
You're miles away
You're miles away

With all your superstitions and empty lines
I could be just like you
Withdrawn but alive

Love could be the only answer it lies underneath

Your eyes they hold the truth and the truth is

If you'd check off my Christmas list

I've been an angel all year

Santa honey, the one thing that I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine

So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Yeah
You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah I do, haha

I look at me now, I'm thinkin, Damn
How proud of me I am
What I did is nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They're hollerin', Shady (Shady)
Yelling it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get the chance to get a crowd
I'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
(I've done it all, man)
But in actuality, I haven't, yet

Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (My only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience (patients) than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
That it would make me a raving lunatic
But I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
And I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two
I'll spit this crazy, even Dre, he knows (nose) I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (Know I talk about this shit a lot, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been

Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flops, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on they grind makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down
You gotta take shots with a hundred proof (Check it out)

Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have had the savage within havin' to win
Every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an emcee
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as Eazy as E
And graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)
'Til my last breath leaves my lungs
I'ma beat my drum (Yeah) for the streets I'm from (Yeah)
The East side slums (Yeah), gotta remind 'em (Yeah)
I'll take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)
You see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, I'm (What?)
Here for the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I've come (Woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm up like your feet in a recliner
And I think I'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (For the last time, my only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey

In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine
Burgundy is fine
Let's drink the bottle every drop

[Chorus:]
Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've got to step into my world
Give me all your luvin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your luvin', give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

[Nicki Minaj:]
Give me all your love boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
I'm Roman
I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, im goin' in

[Bridge:]
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need
Now it's up to y-o-u
Are you the one, shall we proceed?

[M.I.A.:]
Move, it! Licks
I'm some swag shit
No one gives you this
It's super sonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break 'em off tricks
Let's pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

[Chorus:]
Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You've gotta step into my world
Give me all your luvin' give me your love
(L-U-V- Madonna)
Give me all your luvin' give me your love
(Y-O-U You wanna)
Give me all your luvin' give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your luvin' give me your love

When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer

When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer (summer)

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer (summer)
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer, summer
All was golden when the day met the night

So he said, Would it be all right
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?

So she said, That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone in the summer.

Well he was just hanging around
Then he fell in love
And he didn't know how
But he couldn't get out
Just hanging around
Then he fell in love

In the middle of summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, summer, summer, summer
When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

In the middle of summer,summer,summer, summer
the middle of summer, summer, summer, summer

From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same

Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept

All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Three more days 'til I see your face
I'm afraid it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up

If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night
And I know what your friends say,
You're just wasting your love and time.
I will never let you change your mind

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

No need to cry about it
I may just die without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Aaaaahhhhh...

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes

You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you're at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can
Rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And it's hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It'll be alright, they're just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise

Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me
But now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real, while the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal,
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune, make a couple G's and chill,
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair, straight Who could tell me different, look at me, determined,
Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'm a do this

[Chorus:]
I never had a playlist in my heart, oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But I've been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark? oho oh
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in, forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh, oh, oh

Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth,
You won't hear me on the radio, but go to the rave and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus:]
I never had a playlist in my heart, oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But I've been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark oho
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh, oho, oh

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile,
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh
Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh.

I sing of what you see and might think about 
Because of what you see.
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the ear
Not the eye traces what's on the mind

So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends.
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices.

Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone.

So..

When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you are seeing voices.

Think of them as being
As though they were seeing voices. 
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices.

So think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing, voices

Voices, voice

Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone

In the lamplight 
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then

I remember the time 
I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and
I mustn't give in

When the dawn comes 
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun

If you'll touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun...

Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you

‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’

Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on

‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left

You break me

Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'

(Does that scare you?)
(I don't wanna be alone.)

I look for you
Every day
Every night
I close my eyes
From the fear
From the light
As I wander down the avenue so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

Pink lemonade sipping on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine living on a perfect day while my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

I long for you
Just a touch
(Does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

As I wander down the avenue so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

Pink lemonade sipping on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine living on a perfect day while my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (to die for)

Oh, I got a woman

She kiss so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips
Oh, I got a woman

The strangest gal I ever had
Never happy 'less she's mad
Oh, I got a woman

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'

Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

And day and night, I cry for your love
You're not convinced that that is enough
To justify my wanting you
Now tell me what you want me to do
I'm not blind, and I know
That you want to want me, but you can't let go
C'mon, let go

I'm burning up, burning up for your love
I'm burning up, burning up for your love

[Afterwards, Ziegfeld is angry but agrees she was right
to go for the comedy. Nick Arnstein comes backstage
and wants to escort Fanny out to celebrate her opening night.
Fanny would love to go out with Nick but she's obligated to
appear at a party at her mother's saloon; she invites Nick and he accepts.]

[Nick:]
I want to be seen, be seen with you,
With you on my arm,
To wear you like a charm,
Your glitter decorating my arm.
Now, natch'rally such proximity
Gives rumors a rise,
We'll let them analyze
What our amalgamation implies.
Oh yes,
The gossips will press,
So willing to stress
The seamy side--
Know what?
So what!
I want to be seen, be seen with you,
With you on my arm.
Let's give this town a light,
And hit it like a me-te-or-ite-- tonight.
I want to be seen with you.
[Fanny:]
The moon over mother's saloon,
Have a nice macaroon
I'll buy you a light beer.
[Nick:]
Right, dear.

I want to be seen, be seen with you,

With you on my arm.

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah we're feeling so good

Pickin' up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It's just the end of the world

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon

And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?

Back to the place
Where we used to say
Man it feels good to feel this way
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place,
Back to the room where it all began (hey)
Back to the room where it all began
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do

Hello?
Hi. It's me. What's up, baby? I'm sorry. Listen, I'm gonna be late tonight. So, don't stay up and wait for me. OK?
Where are you?
Wait, wait. Say that again?
Hello?
You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me we're going to a place nearby. Alright? Gotta go.

Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, Hi
I got a little place nearby
Wanna go?
I should have said, No
Someone's waiting for me,
But I called my girl up and said

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late. Don't stay up and wait for me
Say again. You're dropping out. My battery is low
Just so you know
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go.

Now two years gone
Nothing's been won
I can't take it back. What's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late. Don't stay up and wait for me
Say again. You're dropping out. My battery is low
Just so you know
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go.

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Hello?

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Hello?

Gotta go

Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, Hi

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late. Don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again. You're just dropping out. My battery is low
Just so you know
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go

Listen, baby, I'm sorry

4273,Elvis Presley,1966,Datin',"soundtrack: Paradise, Hawaiian Style","
_x000D_
Datin' is a game that grown-ups play
Datin' means acting in a silly way
Datin' makes girls start wiggle walking
Datin' makes a guy start baby talking

Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grown-ups are the biggest kids I've found
You'd think they belong in a baby carriage
They're doing things that lead to marriage
But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
'Cause some day you'll be datin' too

Datin' makes a guy comb his hair just right
His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
Datin' makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
And just because it's so much fun to make up

Children can't wait to grow up but then
They're datin and they're acting like kids again
You'd think they belong in a baby carriage
They're doing things that lead to marriage
But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
Some day you'll be datin' too

The same hello, a smile and then we knew at once
That here we are involved again
The same hello and all the things we said
We couldn't bare again are there again

The glow is there, can we pretend
That once again we have a million dreams to spend?
We let it go, it slipped away
How silently two hearts can start to fall apart?

I can't deny I've tried another's arms
And maybe you have too
But even lost inside another's arms
I knew it wasn't you

No fond farewell, no sweet goodbye
Just empty feelings coupled with the wondering why
What words we said or left unsaid
Imagining what could have been or should have been

But here we are, we've come so far
Must you and I say the same goodbye again?

No fond farewell, no sweet goodbye
Just empty feelings coupled with the wondering why
What words we said or left unsaid
Imagining what could have been or should have been

But here we are, we've come so far
Will you and I say the same goodbye again?
